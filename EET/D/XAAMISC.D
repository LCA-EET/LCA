//Changes to miscellaneous dialogs (BG1 / SoA / ToB)
//Generally, this file will contain modifications less than 100 lines long. Modifications 100 lines or longer will typically have their own file.

/* NOTE ON THE USE OF EXTEND_BOTTOM 
	When using EXTEND_BOTTOM to add reply options to a state that originally did not have a reply option, such as the following:
	
	IF ~~ THEN BEGIN StateLabel
		SAY @0  
		
		IF ~~ THEN
		GOTO OtherStateLabel
	END
	
	You need to ADD_TRANS_TRIGGER to the original transition. The trigger you add should be the negation of the trigger associated with your EXTEND_BOTTOM. For example:
	
	ADD_TRANS_TRIGGER DIALOG StateLabel
	~
		!Gender(Player1, MALE)
	~
	
	EXTEND_BOTTOM DIALOG StateLabel
		IF ~
			Gender(Player1, MALE)
		~ THEN REPLY @1 
	END

	THIS IS NOT NECESSARY WHEN YOUR EXTEND_BOTTOM DOES NOT INCLUDE A REPLY.
