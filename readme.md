# Love Conquers All (LCA) Mod for Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition (EE), and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)

<a name="a_mod_overview"></a>
### Overview
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/LCA-EET/LCA/edit/main/xacorwin.png">
<p>
This mod allows Corwin to be added to the party in Shadows of Amn, and Caelar to be added in Throne of Bhaal. Players can either continue the romance they started with Corwin in Siege of Dragonspear, or they can start a new romance with her after her arrival in Athkatla. The mod adds more than 200 new dialogs spread across the four games of the Bhaalspawn saga. Moreover, there are dozens of new items, quests, and cutscenes to enjoy.

### Installation Instructions
<a name="a_installation_instructions"></a>
Unzip the LoveConquersAll_EE.zip archive, and place the LCA folder in your Game Directory (the directory where BG1, SoD, or BG2 is installed. If you plan to install the LCA_Explicit mod, that mod must be installed after this mod (LCA) is installed. Run the provided setup-LCA.exe to install the mod. 
> [!NOTE]
> For EET playthroughs, LCA must be installed in the BG2 directory and after EET core, but before EET_End. 

### EE Playthrough Parameters
<a name="a_ee_params"></a>
For non-EET playthroughs, you can adjust certain parameters to reflect actions that CHARNAME took in a prior game of the series. The parameters file is %MOD_FOLDER%/bg2/lca_bg2_params.txt. Open it and make any desired changes prior to installing the LCA mod.

### LCA Explicit Mod
<a name="a_lca_explicit"></a>
The LCA_Explicit mod adds several explicit, sexual encounters intended for mature audiences only. Current release is available here: <a href="https://github.com/LCA-EET/LCA_Explicit">Link</a>.

### Banter Timers
<a name="a_banter"></a>
Corwin’s (and Caelar’s) scripts each have a banter timer. When the banter timer expires, the script will randomly select a character in your party to initiate a banter. Once a banter is initiated, the banter timer is reset. If there are no more banters available for that character, the script will randomly select another character and repeat the process. The process will continue until all available banters have been exhausted.
> [!NOTE]
> The interval for the banter timer is configurable with the use of the LCA Assistant. By default, it is set to two days.

### Using the Configuration Assistant
<a name="a_config"></a>
A configuration assistant has been provided to help you adjust certain characteristics of the mod. The assistant can be accessed by selecting the “LCA Assistant” special ability from CHARNAME’s special ability menu. The ability is granted to you automatically shortly after the start of your playthrough. 

### LCA Debugger
<a name="a_debugger"></a>
A debugging utility is provided to assist testers with debugging the mod. You can access the debugger through the LCA Assistant, or by, typing the following command into the debugging console:
CLUAConsole:CreateCreature("XALCDBG")
Talk to the creature that is spawned to access the debugging options. 
> [!WARNING]
> Use of the debugger is recommended for testing purposes only. Improper alterations to the game state may prevent you from completing your playthrough.

### Bug Reports

You can also reach me through Discord, as well as the Beamdog and G3 forums (see links below). Including your save game with the bug report is helpful, though optional. I’d also appreciate any feedback or constructive criticism.

### Cross Modding / Forking

### Frequently Asked Questions
<a name="a_faq"></a>
#### Question
I finished BG2 and did the Tears of Bhaal bit and came back to Suldanessellar but I do not seem to be able to leave the room in order to go to Baldurs Gate. How do I progress?

#### Answer
Talk to Corwin. You can talk to her even if she is a party member, same as you would any NPC. She will give you the option to start the "Return to Baldur's Gate" portion of the mod.

#### Question
I've started the Returning the Farseer quest. Where can I find Brevlik?

#### Answer
Brevlik will spawn randomly in one of five locations:

### Baldur's Gate 1 Changes
<a name="a_bg1"></a>

<details>
	<summary>Spoiler Warning! (Click to View)</summary>
	
#### Dialog Changes
Various dialogues were changed to explain what Captain Corwin and other high-ranking Flaming Fist personnel were doing during the events of BG1.

#### Corwin's Home
Speak to the crying girl in Southeast Baldur’s Gate. If you choose the appropriate dialog option, she will mark Corwin’s home on the map for you. Inside the home is an ammo belt and a Flaming Fist training manual. Be sure to check the fireplace as well.
		
</details>

### Siege of Dragonspear Changes
<a name="a_sod"></a>

<details>
	<summary>Spoiler Warning! (Click to View)</summary>

#### Tent Cutscene
In the Coast Way Crossing or the Siege Camp, talk to Thaird while Corwin is in your party. Choose to rest for the night. A special cutscene involving Corwin and CHARNAME will take place.

#### Archery Lesson
If you chose to help with the refugee situation (see below) while in Baldur’s Gate, Corwin will offer to give CHARNAME an archery lesson, if CHARNAME’s proficiency with the shortbow or longbow is greater than zero. She will offer CHARNAME this lesson if CHARNAME has a bow equipped, if CHARNAME is in the Coast Way Crossing, Troll Forest, or the Allied Siege camp, and she has spent the requisite amount of time in the party (at least eighteen hours). Be sure that Corwin and CHARNAME are both standing within sight of Quartermaster Belegarm, otherwise the lesson won’t trigger. The lesson, when completed, will give CHARNAME a permanent +1 boost to missile damage and missile THAC0.

You must do at least three of the following to qualify for the lesson:
- Killed Lon in the old Iron Throne Headquarters.
- Helped Garachen outside the Ducal Palace by providing him the food from Alyth.
- Dealt with the thieves outside of Three Old Kegs.
- Helped Teera pay her debt.
- Worked with Corwin to foil the plot by the nobles in Three Old Kegs to overthrow the Dukes.
- Helped Officer Vida by requesting reinforcements on her behalf.

#### Trial Cutscene
Depending on CHARNAME’s choices, Corwin will vouch for them during the trial in front of the Flaming Fist headquarters.

#### Escape from Avernus
If CHARNAME is male, and the LCA_Explicit mod is installed, a special cutscene will play after the escape from Avernus. Corwin must be in the party, and CHARNAME must be in a romance with her, in order for the cutscene to trigger.

#### Miscellaneous
A number of miscellaneous changes were made to dialogs, particularly the dialogs that occur after CHARNAME is arrested.

#### Corwin's Amulet
If CHARNAME was in a romance with Corwin at the end of SoD, and they were exiled from the city, Imoen will give CHARNAME a letter from Corwin that includes her amulet. The amulet grants some saving throw bonuses, but it can only be worn by CHARNAME.

</details>

### Shadows of Amn (BG2) Changes
<a name="a_bg2"></a>

<details>
	<summary>Spoiler Warning! (Click to View)</summary>

#### Adding Corwin to Your Party
To add Corwin to your party, you must first obtain the Soultaker Dagger from the Djinn in the Plane of Air in Irenicus’ stronghold. Once you have the dagger, speak to Brega in the Athkatla magistrate. He will offer to send the dagger, along with a letter , to Baldur’s Gate if you help him solve the case of the murders in the Bridge District. 

Once the letter is sent, a two-day timer will start. When the timer expires, you will see a cutscene that plays when you choose to sleep. The conclusion of the cutscene will trigger a four-hour timer, that, when expired, will show a second cutscene depicting the restoration of Skie Silvershield. The conclusion of the second cutscene starts the two-day timer that, when expired, will cause Corwin to appear in the Athkatla magistrate building (the same building where you meet Brega). CHARNAME will receive a dialogue prompt when this second timer has expired, so you will know when Corwin has arrived.

To experience the most content possible, it is recommended that you add Corwin as soon as you are able. Hold off on performing quests or even exploring Athkatla (beyond what’s necessary to solve the bridge murders) until Corwin is in your party.

Upon joining your party, if you still possess Corwin’s Amulet, she will take the amulet back and it will be converted to an amulet that can only be worn by Corwin. The saving throw bonuses will be removed, but while wearing the amulet Corwin will be protected from permanent death. The item description does not indicate as such, but it is one of the effects of the item.

#### Slaver Stockade
If Corwin is in your party when you rescue the children from the Slaver Stockade, it will set one of the conditions necessary for the Slaver Conspiracy quest during the Return to Baldur’s Gate.

#### Corwin and Hexxat
Be advised that Corwin and Hexxat, if in the same party, will eventually try to kill each other. Corwin will attempt to rally other good-aligned characters when the time comes.

#### Corwin and Dorn
Corwin and Dorn do not like each other, but they will not come to blows unless Dorn boasts of murdering children while in the service of his patron.

#### Corwin and Neb
If Corwin sees Neb, they will come to blows. If Neb isn’t killed in Athkatla, he will appear in the central sewers, during the Return to Baldur’s Gate quest. 

#### Adventurer’s Mart – Returning the Stolen Artifacts
Speak to Deidre in the Adventurer’s Mart, when Corwin is in the party. The encounter needs to be initiated by either Corwin or CHARNAME. This will begin a quest to return Balduran’s equipment to the Hall of Wonders.

#### Spellhold Encounter
Significant changes were made to the Spellhold encounter with Irenicus. These changes are triggered by Corwin being in the party when the party is captured. 

#### Obtaining Corwin’s Bow + 3 (Gesen)
Bring Corwin’s Bow +2 and Gesen’s bowstring to Cromwell in Athkatla. He will replace the bowstring for a price of 7,500 gold.

#### Obtaining Corwin’s Bow + 3
To obtain Corwin’s Bow + 3, Corwin must be in your party during the battle for Suldanessellar, the party must be in possession of Corwin’s Bow + 2, and you must save the life of the Master Bowyer. The bowyer is located in one of the houses in the city. If all three conditions are satisfied, Corwin’s Bow + 2 will be transformed into the + 3 version after Irenicus is defeated.   

#### Obtaining Corwin’s Bow + 4 (Gesen)
To obtain Corwin’s Bow + 4 (Gesen), Corwin must be in your party during the battle for Suldanessellar, the party must be in possession of Corwin’s Bow + 3 (Gesen), and you must save the life of the Master Bowyer. The bowyer is located in one of the houses in the city. If all three conditions are satisfied, Corwin’s Bow + 3 (Gesen) will be transformed into the + 4 version after Irenicus is defeated.   

#### Obtaining Corwin’s Armor + 4
To obtain Corwin’s Armor + 4, Corwin must be in your party during the battle for Suldanessellar, the party must be in possession of Corwin’s Armor + 2, and you must save the life of the Elven Armorsmith. The Armorsmith is located in one of the houses in the city. If all three conditions are satisfied, Corwin’s Armor + 2 will be transformed into the + 4 version after Irenicus is defeated.   

#### Drizzt Encounter
If CHARNAME attacked Drizzt in Baldur’s Gate 1, Corwin will vouch for CHARNAME if she is in the party when Drizzt and his party confront them after the escape from the Underdark.

#### Trademeet Archery Competition
If Mazzy and Corwin are both in your party, and they’ve completed three rounds of banters, you’ll have the option of visiting Trademeet and have them join an archery competition.

#### Returning to Baldur’s Gate
If Corwin is in your party at the conclusion of the events of Shadows of Amn, you will return to Baldur’s Gate, instead of proceeding immediately with the events of Throne of Bhaal. Upon your arrival, a one-day timer will start, that when expired will initiate the debriefing to the Dukes. The conclusion of the debriefing sets off a series of events that culminate in CHARNAME’s arrival in Saradush. Some people and places you will want to check out while in Baldur’s Gate are listed below:
- Elfsong Tavern 
- Ramazith’s Tower
- Hall of Wonders Cutscene – Requires Corwin to be in the party
- Hall of Wonders – Returning the Farseer (Triggers if CHARNAME stole the Farseer telescope in BG1)
- Corwin’s Home (Located in SE Baldur’s Gate)
- Flaming Fist Headquarters L1 and L2 – Be sure to speak to Marshal Nederlok on the second floor to receive a special gift
- Haspur the Diviner
- Low Lantern (Tianna’s Problem) – Requires Corwin to be in the party
- Central Sewers, if Neb wasn’t killed in Athkatla
- Silvershield Estate
- Iron Throne Headquarters, particularly if you rescued the slaver children in BG2 while Corwin was in your party
- If CHARNAME is in a romance with Corwin
  - Merchant’s League (assuming Aldeth didn’t die during the events of BG1)
  - Seven Suns (assuming Jhasso didn’t die during the events of BG1)
  - Sorcerous Sundries, after visiting the Merchant’s League or Seven Suns and having the discussion about the engagement ring. Speak to Halbazzer and have him enchanted the ring; doing so will enable a very special cutscene after the conclusion of the debriefing for the Dukes
  
The miniquest ends with Rohma’s abduction at the hands of Ilasera and Beno. Depending on the choices CHARNAME has made, at the end of the encounter Beno will be imprisoned, beheaded, or have his soul imprisoned through the use of the Soultaker Dagger. If he is beheaded or has his soul imprisoned, keep the appropriate item (either the head, or the dagger) through Amkethran to trigger a humorous cutscene.

<a name="a_tlr"></a>

<details>
	<summary>Spoiler Warning! (Click to View)</summary>
	
The encounter with Ellesime is moved from the Elder Grove (start of ToB) to Suldanessellar (end of SoA), just before CHARNAME and the party leave for the Return to Baldur's Gate. If Corwin and Irenicus are both in the party, Corwin, after a short time, will rally like-minded party members to kill him, in order to fulfill – a second time – the mission given to her by the Dukes. You'll get a warning about one in-game hour prior to the start of hostilities.
</details>
