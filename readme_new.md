### Overview
<img align="right" src="XACORWIN.PNG">
<p>
This mod allows Corwin to be added to the party in Shadows of Amn, and Caelar to be added in Throne of Bhaal. Players can either continue the romance they started with Corwin in Siege of Dragonspear, or they can start a new romance with her after her arrival in Athkatla. The mod adds more than 200 new dialogs spread across the four games of the Bhaalspawn saga. Moreover, there are dozens of new items, quests, and cutscenes to enjoy.

### Installation Instructions
<a name="a_installation_instructions"></a>
Unzip the LoveConquersAll_EE.zip archive, and place the LCA folder in your Game Directory (the directory where BG1, SoD, or BG2 is installed. If you plan to install the LCA_Explicit mod, that mod must be installed after this mod (LCA) is installed. Run the provided setup-LCA.exe to install the mod. 
> [!NOTE]
> For EET playthroughs, LCA must be installed in the BG2 directory and after EET core, but before EET_End. 
### EE Playthrough Parameters
<a name="a_ee_params"></a>
For non-EET playthroughs, you can adjust certain parameters to reflect actions that CHARNAME took in a prior game of the series. The parameters file is %MOD_FOLDER%/bg2/lca_bg2_params.txt. Open it and make any desired changes prior to installing the LCA mod.

### LCA Explicit Mod
<a name="a_lca_explicit"></a>
The LCA_Explicit mod adds several explicit, sexual encounters intended for mature audiences only. Current release is available here: <a href="https://github.com/LCA-EET/LCA_Explicit/releases">Releases: LCA_Explicit</a>.

### Banter Timers
<a name="a_banter"></a>
Corwin’s (and Caelar’s) scripts each have a banter timer. When the banter timer expires, the script will randomly select a character in your party to initiate a banter. Once a banter is initiated, the banter timer is reset. If there are no more banters available for that character, the script will randomly select another character and repeat the process. The process will continue until all available banters have been exhausted.
> [!NOTE]
> The interval for the banter timer is configurable with the use of the LCA Assistant. By default, it is set to two days.

### Using the Configuration Assistant
<a name="a_config"></a>
A configuration assistant has been provided to help you adjust certain characteristics of the mod. The assistant can be accessed by selecting the “LCA Assistant” special ability from CHARNAME’s special ability menu. The ability is granted to you automatically shortly after the start of your playthrough. 

### LCA Debugger
<a name="a_debugger"></a>
A debugging utility is provided to assist testers with debugging the mod. You can access the debugger through the LCA Assistant, or by, typing the following command into the debugging console:
CLUAConsole:CreateCreature("XALCDBG")
Talk to the creature that is spawned to access the debugging options. 
> [!WARNING]
> Use of the debugger is recommended for testing purposes only. Improper alterations to the game state may prevent you from completing your playthrough.

### Bug Reports
<a name="a_bugs"></a>
If you encounter any bugs or unexplained behavior while playing the mod, please report it to LCAMod@danielvalle.net. You can also reach me through Discord, as well as the Beamdog and G3 forums (see links below). Including your save game with the bug report is helpful, though optional. I’d also appreciate any feedback or constructive criticism.

### Baldur's Gate 1 Changes
<a name="a_bg1"></a>

<details>
	<summary>Spoiler Warning!</summary>
	
#### Dialog Changes
Various dialogues were changed to explain what Captain Corwin and other high-ranking Flaming Fist personnel were doing during the events of BG1.

#### Corwin's Home
Speak to the crying girl in Southeast Baldur’s Gate. If you choose the appropriate dialog option, she will mark Corwin’s home on the map for you. Inside the home is an ammo belt and a Flaming Fist training manual. Be sure to check the fireplace as well.

### Siege of Dragonspear Changes
<a name="a_sod"></a>

<details>
	<summary>Spoiler Warning!</summary>

#### Tent Cutscene
In the Coast Way Crossing or the Siege Camp, talk to Thaird while Corwin is in your party. Choose to rest for the night. A special cutscene involving Corwin and CHARNAME will take place.

#### Archery Lesson
If you chose to help with the refugee situation (see note below) while in Baldur’s Gate, Corwin will offer to give CHARNAME an archery lesson, if CHARNAME’s proficiency with the shortbow or longbow is greater than zero. She will offer CHARNAME this lesson if CHARNAME has a bow equipped, if CHARNAME is in the Coast Way Crossing, Troll Forest, or the Allied Siege camp, and she has spent the requisite amount of time in the party (at least eighteen hours). Be sure that Corwin and CHARNAME are both standing within sight of Quartermaster Belegarm, otherwise the lesson won’t trigger. The lesson, when completed, will give CHARNAME a permanent +1 boost to missile damage and missile THAC0.
> [!NOTE]
> You must do at least three of the following:
> -	Killed Lon in the old Iron Throne Headquarters.
> -	Helped Garachen outside the Ducal Palace by providing him the food from Alyth.
> -	Dealt with the thieves outside of Three Old Kegs.
> -	Helped Teera pay her debt.
> -	Worked with Corwin to foil the plot by the nobles in Three Old Kegs to overthrow the Dukes.
> -	Helped Officer Vida by requesting reinforcements on her behalf.

#### Trial Cutscene
Depending on CHARNAME’s choices, Corwin will vouch for them during the trial in front of the Flaming Fist headquarters.

#### Escape from Avernus
If CHARNAME is male, and the LCA_Explicit mod is installed, a special cutscene will play after the escape from Avernus. Corwin must be in the party, and CHARNAME must be in a romance with her, in order for the cutscene to trigger.
