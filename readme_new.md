# Love Conquers All (LCA) Mod for Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition (EE), and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)

<a name="a_mod_overview"></a>
### Overview
<img align="right" src="XACORWIN.PNG">
This mod allows Corwin to be added to the party in Shadows of Amn, and Caelar to be added in Throne of Bhaal. Players can either continue the romance they started with Corwin in Siege of Dragonspear, or they can start a new romance with her after her arrival in Athkatla. The mod adds more than 200 new dialogs spread across the four games of the Bhaalspawn saga. Moreover, there are dozens of new items, quests, and cutscenes to enjoy.

### Installation Instructions
<a name="a_installation_instructions"></a>
Unzip the LoveConquersAll_EE.zip archive, and place the LCA folder in your Game Directory (the directory where BG1, SoD, or BG2 is installed. For EET playthroughs, LCA must be installed in the BG2 directory and after EET core, but before EET_End. If you plan to install the LCA_Explicit mod, that mod must be installed after this mod (LCA) is installed. Run the provided setup-LCA.exe to install the mod. 

### EE Playthrough Parameters
<a name="a_ee_params"></a>
For non-EET playthroughs, you can adjust certain parameters to reflect actions that CHARNAME took in a prior game of the series. The parameters file is %MOD_FOLDER%/bg2/lca_bg2_params.txt. Open it and make any desired changes prior to installing the LCA mod.

### LCA Explicit Mod
<a name="a_lca_explicit"></a>
The LCA_Explicit mod adds several explicit, sexual encounters intended for mature audiences only. Current release is available here: <a href="https://github.com/LCA-EET/LCA_Explicit/releases">Releases: LCA_Explicit</a>.

### Banter Timers
<a name="a_banter"></a>
Corwin’s (and Caelar’s) scripts each have a banter timer. When the banter timer expires, the script will randomly select a character in your party to initiate a banter. Once a banter is initiated, the banter timer is reset. If there are no more banters available for that character, the script will randomly select another character and repeat the process. The process will continue until all available banters have been exhausted.
NOTE: The interval for the banter timer is configurable with the use of the LCA Assistant. By default, it is set to two days.
