@0 =  ~Oh, Schael, excuse me, Captain Corwin, I didn't see you at first.~
@1 = ~Yes, Commander Scar told me about your plan to seek <CHARNAME>'s company but wasn't sure if they'd accept the offer. I'm glad they did.~ 
@2 = ~<CHARNAME>, if you need to talk to Scar, he is in the Flaming Fist headquarters in the southwest quadrant of the city. Captain Corwin can show you the way. Good luck with your investigation.~
