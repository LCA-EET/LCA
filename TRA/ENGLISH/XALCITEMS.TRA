@0 = ~Officers Training Manual~
@1 = ~This appears to be a Flaming Fist officers' training manual. It includes policies and procedures covering incident investigations, suspect apprehension techniques, proper etiquette when dealing with city officials, and much more. The initials "S.C." are written on the inside cover. It's clear that "S.C", whoever they are, has spent a great many hours studying the manual intently; it is well-worn, and some of the pages are coming loose from the binding.~
