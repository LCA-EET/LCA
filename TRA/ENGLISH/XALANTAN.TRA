@0 = ~You've returned! I had another dream about you last night - it was horrible!~
@1 = ~I remember you. You dreamt that I would be stripped of my power ... of what that bastard Irenicus would eventually do to me. Tell me what you saw in your dream this time that I might learn of what is to come.~
@2 = ~Keep away and do not trouble me with your ravings, hag.~
@3 = ~You were standing in a - in a ruined city, knee deep in the dead. Men, women, children all slaughtered... but... it was not your doing. The city was surrounded by five.. five...~
@4 = ~Five what?~
@5 = ~Five a-abominations, each worse than the next! And there was another, directing their actions from the shadows. She set them against you, and you prevailed! But.. as they turned to dust, she absorbed their essence. She grew in power and stature until ... until she blotted out the sun! It was at that point that my husband mercifully woke me from my restless slumber. Beware, hero!~ 
@6 = ~To the hells with you then!~
