@0 = ~<CHARNAME>... You've returned.~
@1 = ~I recognize you... Ashatiel. Caelar's right hand.~
@2 = ~Why are you here, Bhaalspawn?~
@3 = ~I could ask you the same thing. Why haven't you moved on, spirit? There's an entrance to the Fugue Plane not ten paces from you.~
@4 = ~We tried, but we cannot.~
@5 = ~We? There are others?~
@6 = ~The Shining Lady's most devoted followers swore an oath to serve her in life... and in death. Those who took part in the ritual... we're still bound by that oath, and we cannot move on.~
@7 = ~Wait... if you're still bound to serve her, that must mean...~
@8 = ~Yes. She's still alive, in Avernus. Though something has changed...~
@9 = ~She still lives!? After all this time?~
@10 = ~That she's still alive doesn't surprise me.~
@11 = ~You've no reason to help us. To go back to that horrible place, and rescue our Shining Lady... All I can offer you is our eternal gratitude.~
@12 = ~I barely escaped the first time. I'm sorry, but there's no way I'm going back there.~
@13 = ~You said something has changed. What did you mean?~
@14 = ~We're bound to her life force. Until recently, it was very strong. Now, it is very faint. I feel as though something terrible has happened to her.~
@15 = ~If that's the case, then she'll be dead soon enough. You'll be free to move on, spirit.~
@16 = ~Perhaps... but if there's a way you can help her, in spite of the death and destruction that she â€” that *we* caused.~
@17 = ~I understand... Go in peace, <CHARNAME>.~
@18 = ~Since we last met, I've gained access to a planar gate. Perhaps I can use it to reach Avernus.~
@19 = ~I recognize you... Ashatiel. The Shining Lady's lapdog.~
@20 = ~We? How many of you are there?~
@21 = ~See for yourself. Crusaders! Reveal yourselves!~
@22 = ~It's none of your concern, spirit.~
@23 = ~I remember you, Ashatiel. You were as brave as you were foolish.~
@24 = ~To kill you once again, spirit!~
@25 = ~If that were possible, I'd welcome it.~ 
@26 = ~Then I wish you good luck. If you're successful, you must bring Caelar back to us, that she may release us from our servitude. Only then will we be able to move on.~
@27 = ~I won't help you. Caelar is exactly where she belongs.~
@28 = ~Remember, you must bring Caelar here so that she can release us from our oath. Only then will we be able to move on to whatever awaits us.~
