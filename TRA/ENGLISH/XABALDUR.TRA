@31 = ~Corwin's Tutelage
Captain Corwin noticed a couple of problems with my bow grip. She taught me the difference between the pivot and pressure points, and showed me the proper use of my palm to support the pressure of the bow. With these changes, my accuracy and power have improved.~

Schael and I made love for the first time. I feel revitalized â€” it was an amazing, extremely passionate experience that the two of us will remember for as long as we live.~
@33 = ~Love Conquers All
Schael shared a number of submission and other hand-to-hand techniques with me to improve my effectiveness in combat. I also gained some valuable insight into who's really in charge, at least when it comes to certain activities in the bedroom.~

Schael and I shared an intensely passionate and romantic evening together. It was well worth the wait.~
