@2 = ~I have slain Bodhi and retrieved the Rhynn Lanthorn. I must return to Elhan near the Underdark entrance with it so that the way to Suldanessellar can be opened. Perhaps now Elhan will also answer some of my questions about Irenicus's true history with the elves. He may also be able to help you find a way to revive and reverse the vampiric curse placed on Schael.~
