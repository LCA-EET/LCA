@2 = ~That might be difficult.~
@3 = ~I bow to no one.~
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~IT MATTERS NOT. I WILL DEVOUR YOURS INSTEAD, THEN USE YOUR BODY TO RULE THIS PLANE. PREPARE TOâ€”~
@6 = ~It may please you to know that he is dead.~
@7 = ~HAHAHAH. YOU FOOLS WERE FREED AS WELL? SO MUCH THE BETTER!~
@8 = ~Soultaker Dagger
