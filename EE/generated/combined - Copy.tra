Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.

(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Healing 
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The Cure Critical Wounds spell is a very potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell. The priest lays <PRO_HISHER> hands upon a creature and heals 27 points of damage from wounds or other injuries. The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those not living.~

(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This unique ability allows Caelar to hurl a bolt of divine energy at an enemy once per day, dealing them 5d6 points of magic damage. Undead creatures and fiends are particularly susceptible to the bolt's effects, suffering double damage when they are struck. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this ability.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1

Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 8-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes total, impenetrable darkness. Neither normal nor magical light works in the area of effect. All vision (including infravision) is severely limited; anyone hostile caught in the area of effect is for all practical purposes blinded as per the 1st-level wizard spell. Creatures that leave the area covered by darkness will have their vision restored after 1 round.~

He favored purple clothing, believing it was a color the god preferred, and he crafted this belt to match his ensemble. The thief was eventually caught and killed on one of his missions and the belt confiscated by the city guard. The next night, the belt vanished from a locked chest in the guardhouse, though, whisked away by Mask so that it could continue to serve the god's ends. Even today, the belt often finds its way into the path of those who will put it to good use.

The pouches attached to the belt contain a number of small tools, wires, picks, and blades that can be used to pick locks and disable traps.

Bloodied and wild-eyed, clutching Lady Brightsworn's helm in his hands, he relayed a tale of the nightmarish warrens the group had found and the vampire who culled them from their group, slaughtering them one by one.

Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.

The cursed cornugon’s body was dismantled by his peers, in the hopes that destroying him would end the curse; but the disparate pieces of Thel’blax’s body continued to prick and tear at any who approached. At last, Dispater ordered his ironsmiths to forge the pieces into a suit of armor, intending to use it as a means of torturing insubordinates. Inevitably, the armor fell into the hands of intrepid (if foolhardy) adventurers, who then brought the piece to Faerûn.

Even now, the curse of Thel’blax affects the armor, causing its barbs to sink painfully into the flesh of anyone wearing it. It provides a measure of protection, behaving like hide armor, and even allows the wearer to benefit from Thel’blax’s resilience; but the constant stinging and flaying from the cornugon’s still-living barbs make this armor unsuitable for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach.
