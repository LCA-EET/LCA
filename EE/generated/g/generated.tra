Each of the robe's dozens of patches was cut from the robe of an enemy tribe's shaman. This makes the Ghostdreamers' Robe more than an article of clothing; it is a physical representation of the dak'Dekanters' victories over the centuries and a symbol of power for the shaman who wears it.

@20118 = ~Hide armor is made from the thick hide of a very large animal (an elephant for example) or from many layers of normal leather from common animals, like cows. Hide armor is far too bulky, inflexible and heavy to be used much in advanced human cultures. However, among the barbaric humanoid masses throughout the dark forests and misty jungles of the world, hide armor is common. Even though it does offer more protection than leather armor, one must get by the offensive odor and shoddy appearance in order to wear it effectively. Even though Thieves can wear this armor, it has a negative effect on their abilities.

@20119 = ~Once worn by the dekanter goblin warlord Kruntur, this armor is of an unusually high quality considering the race of its owner—most non-goblin smiths won't bother making armor suitable for goblinoid physiques, while those few goblins who know how to use a forge are generally more focused on weaponry. Kruntur prized this armor to such a degree that, upon his death, he refused to leave it. To this day, more than a hundred years later, his spirit still permeates the armor, whispering threats to all who dare wear it and generally making a nuisance of himself. He cannot directly harm the wearer, however, and for a goblinoid, the chance to have such fine protection might well make up for the aggravation the armor brings with it.
