@3   = ~From where do you hail, sailor?~
@4   = ~Aye, she's a fine ship who moves at a fast clip, there's ne'er been better, you have my word. We'd 'ave outsailed Balduran 'imself, were 'e still 'ere to meet th' challenge!~
@5   = ~What's dat? Aye, I be a salt-encrusted citizen of the High Seas, I be, an' a ten-times survivor of the scurvy wastin'. Neverwinter, Waterdeep, the Gate, Athkatlaâ€”I'll lay anchor in them all but I'll ne'er rest easy wit' their shiftless firmaments beneat' me.~
