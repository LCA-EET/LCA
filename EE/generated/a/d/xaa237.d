I met Dun the ex-merchant in the city streets today. He has some interesting suspicions about the Seven Suns and the Merchants' League, two mercantile groups here in Baldur's Gate. He is apparently quite in their debt financially, but, for some unknown reason, they have stopped pressuring him for repayment. Indeed, they seem almost frightened whenever he approaches them and tries to catch their eye. I cannot yet fathom the relevance of this to my investigation. Still, this whole affair has been motivated by greed, business, and money from the start. If merchant groups in the largest city in the region are acting suspicious, I had best take note...~ #27008 */ EXIT
