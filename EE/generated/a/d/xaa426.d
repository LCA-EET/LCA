They're a new mercantile organization that have set up in Baldur's Gate. Most of us are rather concerned over some of the Iron Throne's actions, but they have promised to supply us with iron, a resource that has been very rare of late. We are suspicious of Amn, our neighbor to the south. We think that Amn has allied with the Zhentarim in an attempt to annex our glorious city. However, Scar feels that the evidence against Amn was too easy to come by, almost as if someone were trying to frame Amn to cause friction between our two nations. Since you are my best friend, I should tell you I have a very beautiful daughter. Her name is Skie, and she is now of marriageable age.~ #6136 */
