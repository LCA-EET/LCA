My name is Destus Gurn, Assistant Chief Accountant for the Iron Throne's operations on the Sword Coast. Now, just a quick briefing on our negotiating procedures before you head on up the stairs: Thaldorn will be accompanied by a board of six Iron Throne advisors sent to us from abroad: Zhalimar Cloudwulfe, Gardush, Naaman, Diyab, Aasim, and Alai, all of them quite respectable men and eager to meet you. We also have a seventh member on that board today, a Mr. Lyle Espejo. He is there to ensure that things go smoothly in this time of transition. As for the agendaâ€”~ #20324 */

It seems the Iron Throne is negotiating a treaty with the city's Grand Dukes.

Will money satisfy the Throne's greed, or is there something more behind it all? I have so many questions.
