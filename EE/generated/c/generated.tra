He favored purple clothing, believing it was a color the god preferred, and he crafted this belt to match his ensemble. The thief was eventually caught and killed on one of his missions and the belt confiscated by the city guard. The next night, the belt vanished from a locked chest in the guardhouse, though, whisked away by Mask so that it could continue to serve the god's ends. Even today, the belt often finds its way into the path of those who will put it to good use.

The pouches attached to the belt contain a number of small tools, wires, picks, and blades that can be used to pick locks and disable traps.

Bloodied and wild-eyed, clutching Lady Brightsworn's helm in his hands, he relayed a tale of the nightmarish warrens the group had found and the vampire who culled them from their group, slaughtering them one by one.

@45975 = ~The devil Thel’blax was a scourge against the armies of the Abyss until he was assassinated by the servants of his own master, Dispater. With his final breath, Thel’blax cursed his own body to never lie still even in death. When his body was carried to the Iron Tower, Thel’blax’s horns and barbs continued to thrash about as though alive.

The cursed cornugon’s body was dismantled by his peers, in the hopes that destroying him would end the curse; but the disparate pieces of Thel’blax’s body continued to prick and tear at any who approached. At last, Dispater ordered his ironsmiths to forge the pieces into a suit of armor, intending to use it as a means of torturing insubordinates. Inevitably, the armor fell into the hands of intrepid (if foolhardy) adventurers, who then brought the piece to Faerûn.

Even now, the curse of Thel’blax affects the armor, causing its barbs to sink painfully into the flesh of anyone wearing it. It provides a measure of protection, behaving like hide armor, and even allows the wearer to benefit from Thel’blax’s resilience; but the constant stinging and flaying from the cornugon’s still-living barbs make this armor unsuitable for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach.
