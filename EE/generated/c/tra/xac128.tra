@1   = ~Hello. I am the level coordinator. Is there anything I can help you with?~
@2   = ~No, I don't need your help.~
@3   = ~Could you tell me where I could find Tethtoril?~
@4   = ~I was wondering where I could find Ulraunt?~
@5   = ~Tethtoril is a very busy man, and I don't keep track of his schedule. Sorry.~
@6   = ~You can find Ulraunt in his apartment on the sixth floor. I wouldn't bother him there though; he doesn't like unannounced intrusions.~
@7   = ~Good friend, would you like me to give you a sermon on the wisdom of Oghma? No? Well, perhaps another time then.~
@8   = ~It would be wise for you to leave. Now.~
