@1   = ~You must be the new servants and guards, well keep your place! It is an honor for you to be working here! Imagine, a Duchess overseeing such a transaction such as this in my own house. Surely this will turn my competitors absolutely green!~
@2   = ~I know not who you are, but because of my guests, I will refrain from having you outright killed. I advise you to leave quickly lest I change my mind. I'll not tolerate strangers loitering about my house on such an occasion as this!~
@3   = ~Guards! Murderers in my home! Kill them!~
@4   = ~Guards! There are intruders in the mansion! To arms!~
@5   = ~It is a great honor for me to have such a transaction taking place in my home. Shandalar's daughters are here, and so is the Grand Duchess. It's a good thing I hired extra guards, though I have little to fear from you, my newfound friend.~
@6   = ~You're not welcome here! Get out or be thrown out!~
