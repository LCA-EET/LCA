@0=~It has begun. Even before I left for Saradush, the news had already begun pouring in from everywhere... tales of armies on the move, whole towns being destroyed to get at some lone wizard, massive carnage and destruction along the entire Sword Coast. It all links to the Bhaalspawn. They are being hunted, or hunting each other... whatever the case, wherever a child of Bhaal is, violence soon follows. And so the fear and panic have spread, with any innocent even suspected of having the taint being driven from their homes or killed outright. Baldur's Gate is not immune, and I sensed considerable relief upon my departure from the very city that I helped save. The caravan has reached its destination on the outskirts of the forest to the northwest of Saradush. While traversing the woods, I've come across this strange grove, filled with ancient stone carvings. There is a strange energy in the air... I will investigate the grove, then continue on toward Saradush.~
@1=~The Spirits of the Forest await. Check through your possessions and spells. Once you are prepared for whatever may come, click on one of the stone heads to speak to the gods.~
@2=~Your hear loud footsteps and feel the ground tremor beneath you... fire giants, to the south!
They must have seen the caravan â€” prepare for battle!~
