@1=~Wha... Get back! Who are ye? More of Ramazith's trickery, or are ye paired with that snake Degrodel? I swear none shall see the day when I get between feuding mages ever again! Well? Speak up! Are ye for me or against me?~
@2=~I am neither, as I care little for you at all. I released you to find the Helm of Balduran.~
@3=~I saved you from your prison of stone, did I not? I ask only one thing for this: that you give me the Helm of Balduran.~
@4=~I see. Well, I do not have such an item, nor would I tell you if I did. Dead with a treasure would be better than living without. Question the others if ye will; I care only that I can walk once more.~
@5=~I suppose such a request is reasonable, though I cannot fulfill it. I do not have such a thing, though you may ask the others in my party. Perhaps they know where this helm can be found, though if it were me, I would not tell you. Such a treasure is worth dying for.~
@6=~Whaâ€”? Get back! Who are ye? More of Ramazith's trickery, or are ye paired with that snake Degrodel? I swear none shall see the day when I get between feuding mages ever again!~
