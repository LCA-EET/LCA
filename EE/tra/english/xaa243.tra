@1=~Well, that was unpleasant. I thank you for my freedom. I take it that I was petrified by the basilisk? That mage was one wily customer. I hope the creature turned on him before he could dispel it. I am Cailan, and you are...?~
@2=~I am your savior and I demand the Helm of Balduran! That is my price for rescuing you!~
@3=~I am <CHARNAME>, and I have a request for you. I seek the Helm of Balduran, and was told it was in your possession.~
@4=~Indeed? Well, I cannot help you; I do not have that item. Perhaps one of my fellows carries such a thing, but I know not. If you rescue them as you did me I am sure you will find it, though I would soften your tone. Some of my companions take offense easily.~
@5=~Hmm, I do not have such a thing in my possession, though one of my companions may. I cannot say for certain though, as I have not known them for long. Not counting the time spent frozen with them, of course.~
@6=~Well, that was unpleasant. I thank you for my freedom. I take it that I was petrified by the basilisk? That mage was one wiley customer. I hope the creature turned on him before he could dispel it. I must be on my way now, as I have many things to do.~
