@2=~You sure you don't want me with you?~ [xalc1160]
@4=~They, ah... seem to have exaggerated some of your... attributes.~
@5=~Yes. It's a beautiful statue.~
@6=~It doesn't do you justice, I'm afraid.~
@7=~Flatterer.~ [xalc1063]
@9=~Neb! By order of the Flaming Fist you are under arrest!~ [xalc1168]
@10=~Are you alright? It looked for a moment like you were about to keel over.~
@11=~I felt some dizziness... it's nothing, I'll be fine.~
@12=~Let's just focus on getting out of here. I'll feel better once I'm out of this hole.~
@13=~Here, put your arm around my shoulder. I'll help keep you steady. Just take it easy, <CHARNAME>.~
@14=~Here, put your arm around my shoulder. I'll help keep you steady. Just take it easy, love.~
@15=~Right. Let me know if you need anything.~
@16=~Gods, what was that <CHARNAME>? You turned into a monster!~
@17=~What in the hells did Irenicus do to you?~
@18=~I... I don't know Schael. I felt ... it was like an unbridled rage, and then ... then I blacked out.~
@19=~I turned into what?~
@20=~I don't know how else to describe it... <CHARNAME>, it was terrifying. ~
@21=~I've never seen anything like that before, and I hope to never again.~
@22=~I — I'm sorry that you had to see that. Please, just keep your distance, in case it happens again.~
@23=~Love, are you feeling any better? Let me help get you on your feet — we need to keep moving.~
@24=~Schael, please stay away, for your own safety.~
@25=~Keep back, I think — yes, it's happening again!~
@26=~Get as far away from me as possible, now!~
@27=~What's wrong <CHARNAME>... your lips are moving but I can't hear you speak.. wait.. no... not again... NO!~
@28=~My love, you could've killed me. I can't risk... we can't be together if you can't get this under control.~
@29=~Schael, if I lose control again and put you or anyone else in danger, kill me. I couldn't bear to know that I'd harmed you.~
@30=~I don't know how to control it, or even if I can. Keep your distance, please.~
@31=~I know that whatever this is, I'll get it under control. ~
@32=~And I couldn't bear to live knowing that I killed the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I love. Let's just hope it doesn't come to that.~
@33=~You need me by your side now, more than ever. Don't worry — I'll stay clear if it looks like it's about to happen again.~
@34=~Good. We'll get through this together, whatever it takes. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.~
@35=~Agreed. Let's go.~
@36=~Thank you Schael... let's go.~
@37=~Quickly, we'd better give these lunatics some direction, or they may turn on us.~
@38=~You've got to be kidding me. A deal? With you?~
@39=~<CHARNAME>, I'm going with you. We've come this far together, and I love you too much to turn back now.~
@40=~I love you too Schael, more than you know. Thank you... for everything.~
@41=~I love you too Schael. You needn't risk yourself any further. Think of your father. Think of Rohma.~
@42=~Irenicus needs to be stopped. While he's alive no one is safe, and that includes Rohma. Being at your side is the best way I can protect her, and Baldur's Gate.~
@43=~Thank you, my love.~
@44=~Schael, you're the strongest, most determined woman I've ever known. You'll be fine.~
@45=~It's going to hurt, for a while. The pain of not having you near me, of not waking up in your arms... it might never go away. Rohma will be heartbroken too. But you're right... we'll learn to live with it, and we'll be stronger for it.~
@46=~Got everything you need?~ [xalc1142]
@47=~No, <CHARNAME>. I'm coming with you. Irenicus needs to be stopped. While he's alive no one is safe, and that includes Rohma. Being at your side is the best way I can protect her, and Baldur's Gate.~
@48=~Thank you Schael... for everything.~
@49=~And you shall have it, my friend. Irenicus must be stopped, before he can destroy any more innocent lives.~
@50=~I'm with you, <CHARNAME>. Irenicus must be stopped, before he can destroy any more innocent lives.~
@51=~No, Madame, <PRO_HESHE> doesn't need anything from this whorehouse.~
@53=~Heh. Don't look so disappointed, love. There'll be plenty of time for those... activities... once we get back to Baldur's Gate.~
@54=~He kidnapped my daughter, so we killed him. His head was taken to prevent him from being resurrected yet again. If you're here to exact some sort of revenge, then you're making a big mistake.~
@55=~As do I. Let's go love. We've work to do.~
@56=~He kidnapped my daughter, so we killed him. His soul was taken to prevent him from being resurrected yet again. If you're here to exact some sort of revenge, then you're making a big mistake.~
@58=~I look forward to it.~
@59=~Why wait?~
@60=~Mm. As much as I want to, this is hardly the time or place, and duty must come before pleasure. Let's go love. We've work to do.~
@61=~Mm, is that an order, hero?~
@62=~Let's go find some place a little more private...~ [xalc1169]
@63=~What did you have in mind?~
@64=~The street in mid-day, or perhaps the amphitheater. Gods, what do you think? There are plenty of inns in the city, pick one!~ [xalc1041]
@65=~Come with me love, I know just the place.~
@66=~When I said to get us a room, I didn't mean this dump. It's filthy. Let's go to one of the cleaner establishments in the city.~ [xalc1042]
@67=~Right... sorry, love.~
@68=~The rats bother you, eh?~
@69=~Rats, slavers, thieves, the stench, all of it bothers me. Let's go.~
@70=~I already told you, we're not making love in this dump.~
@71=~You know what? Forget it. I'm not in the mood anymore. Let's go.~ [xalc1043]
@72=~And look at the reflection of the moonlight on the stream...~
@80=~Come here...~ [xalc1170]
@81=~(You share a tender and emotional embrace.)~
@82=~I'm covered in him! Gods, you are too!~
@83=~Oh, you're so precious!~
@84=~It seems you two have taken a liking to each other.~
@85=~I didn't know you liked animals, Captain.~
@86=~Somehow, I didn't think you a cat person.~
@87=~I love animals. When I was a kid, I had a hamster, then a dog. But never a cat. I want to — ah, nevermind.~
@88=~What is it?~
@89=~Right. Dings, back in the pack you go.~
@90=~Rohma always wanted a pet. I was hesitant to get her one, but now that she's a little older... they're great for teaching responsibility. Dings would be perfect, and I know she'd love him.~ [xalc1206]
@91=~Take him, then. I'm sure he'd feel right at home with you and Rohma.~
@92=~Sorry, but I plan to keep him.~
@93=~Fair enough. Let's get going.~
@94=~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I really appreciate it.~
@95=~Dings, sweetie! Back in the pack, it's time to go.~
@98=~At least he won't be coming back this time... Pray to Tymora that there's a bathhouse in this village. Let's go.~
@106=~I don't know what I should do.~
@108=~(She smiles, and places her arms around your shoulders.)~
@109=~Gods know it's been too long already.~
@115=~Gladly, my dear.~
@117=~Thank goodness... wait... children? You mean...~
@118=~Oh my...~
@119=~Oh, my love. I... I knew this was coming. You did too, I think... those nightmares you had about this very decision. But knowing that this was coming doesn't make it any easier, now that it's here. I tried to — to somehow convince myself that there was a future for us... but deep down, I knew.~
@120=~(She takes hold of your hand.)~
@121=~I want you to know that I'll always treasure our time together... and I'll tell our children about what an amazing man their father was. A hero, in every sense of the word. I love you, <CHARNAME>, now and always.~
@122=~I don't want to leave you, Schael. I love you, more than anything.~
@123=~Love, children, and a life together with you... it's all that I could ever want. But I don't have to choose between that, and godhood. I don't know how anyone could...~
@126=~You think I should give up the essence?~
@127=~I won't lie to you. I want you to stay. Love, children, and a life together with you... it's all that I could ever want. But I don't have to choose between that, and godhood. I don't know how anyone could...~
@128=~I'm sorry, Schael. I feel I have to go forward and accept my birthright.~
@129=~I know. After everything you've been through... everything you've had to endure. You deserve it.~
@130=~<CHARNAME>. We need to talk.~
@131=~What is it, Captain?~
@132=~Of course love, what's on your mind?~
@133=~The vampire, Hexxat. You allow this beast to travel with us?~
@134=~We need her, Schael.~
@135=~And what of it?~
@136=~You're going to have to make a decision, and soon, or I'll make it for you. I trust that I've made myself clear.~
@137=~Your time has come, vampire. Allies, to me! Let's rid the world of this beast once and for all!~
@138=~Your time has come, vampire. Draw steel! ~
@148=~(Leave her be.)~
@161=~I want you to know that I'll always treasure our time together... and I'll tell our child about what an amazing man their father was. A hero, in every sense of the word. I love you, <CHARNAME>, now and always.~
@178=~I want you to know that I'll always treasure our time together... You're a hero, in every sense of the word. I love you, <CHARNAME>, now and always.~
@179=~Love, Rohma, and a life together with you... it's all that I could ever want. But I don't have to decide between that, and godhood. I don't know how anyone could...~
@185=~I won't lie to you. I want you to stay. Love, Rohma, and a life together with you... it's all that I could ever want. But I don't have to decide between that, and godhood. I don't know how anyone could...~
@199=~I've gone as far as I can. When you regain your senses, you can find me at the Athkatla magistrate.~
@201=~I don't believe it! <CHARNAME>, this is Neb, the fugitive who murdered more than two dozen children in Baldur's Gate!~
@202=~He's dead...~
@203=~The worst kind. (Hold her hands in yours.) Are you alright, love?~
@204=~The worst kind. Are you alright, Schael?~
@205=~I will be. What he said about Rohma...~
@206=~I wouldn't worry about it. He was just trying to rattle you.~
@207=~Whatever his intentions, it doesn't matter now. He's dead, and the world is a better place for it.~
@208=~You're right...~
@209=~We better let Inspector Brega know what happened here. Come on, let's go.~ [xalc1044]
@210=~(Her hands tremble with anger.)~
@211=~What kind of monster could murder one child, let alone dozens?~
@212=~(She calms down.)~
@213=~We better let Inspector Brega know what happened here. Come on, let's go.~ [xalc1044]
@214=~Thank you.~ [xalc1171]
@215=~What does Irenicus gain from a war between the surface elves and the drow? There must be a reason.~ [xalc1254]
@216=~You were with her for a while...~
@217=~Listen, Schael. She didn't leave me any choice. I had to in order to maintain our cover.~
@218=~It meant nothing to me. You're the one that I love.~
@219=~And? I did what I needed to, nothing more.~
@220=~It means something to me. I understand though why you had to. Let's just get out of this hole and forget that it ever happened.~ [xalc1045]
@221=~I understand. Let's just get out of this hole and forget that it ever happened.~
@222=~I see. And did you enjoy it?~
@223=~To be perfectly honest, I did.~
@224=~That's none of your concern.~
@225=~No, I didn't. I feel nothing toward her but disgust.~
@226=~You've changed, love, and not in a good way. I can only hope that you'll be yourself again once we've restored what the wizard stole from you. Let's go.~
@227=~What'd she want?~ [xalc1046]
@228=~For me to sleep with her.~
@229=~Better not to ask. What matters is that she didn't get it.~
@230=~Really — how'd you manage to get out of that one?~ [xalc1194]
@231=~I told her you'd kill me for cheating on you.~
@232=~Hah! In spite of everything, you haven't lost your sense of humor. Come love, let's get going.~
@233=~Hm, I didn't see her as the type to be so easily turned away. Let's go love.~
@234=~A little.~ [xalc1144]
@235=~What have we here?~ [xalc1056]
@236=~Here it comes...~ [xalc1115]
@237=~There's nothing that gets my blood pumping like seeing a strong, beautiful woman in uniform... Come, love, and let us get to know each other over a drink or two.~
@238=~Oh, let's not, please.~ [xalc1116]
@239=~I wonder... what delightful pleasures are you hiding behind all of that armor? I'll show you mine if you show me yours...~
@240=~For the love of the gods, save that filth for a chamberpot!~ [xalc1108]
@244=~We... we still have each other. Irenicus is here — I'm sure you feel it as well. Come, love. Let's finish what we set out to do!~
@245=~You... you monster! What you did to Skie, to Imoen, to <CHARNAME>, and the others... it can never be forgiven. You nearly destroyed my hope of a future with the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I love. Prepare to meet your end, Irenicus!~
@246=~Can you feel that? Irenicus is here too, isn't he? Very well... <CHARNAME>, let's finish what we set out to do!~
@247=~Irenicus already tried to force us apart and failed. You'll do no better.~ [xalc1047]
@248=~What... what is this place? Did we die? Then why... no... no! Rohma, father... I'm so sorry.~
@249=~Thanks, but...~
@250=~(She nods in your direction.)~
@251=~My <PRO_MANWOMAN>'s got me covered.~
@252=~(A fleeting smile graces her face.)~
@253=~Let's just get out of this hole and forget that it ever happened.~ [xalc1255]
@254=~That's enough, all of you. You there!~
@255=~(She takes a moment to regain her composure.)~
@256=~(He points at Corwin.)~
@258=~Who are you, and what is your business here?~
@259=~*Cough* Hey, can we... can we s-stop, for just a minute.~ [xalc1006]
@260=~Schael? What's wrong?~
@261=~I can't *wheeze* ... I can't seem ... to catch my breath.~
@262=~Come here, love. Put your arm around my shoulder. Take as much time as you need.~
@263=~(She takes several long, deep breaths.)~
@264=~(She's clearly unwell and her condition is rapidly deteriorating... you resolve to redouble your efforts to find and kill Bodhi. You hope it will be enough to cure Schael of her affliction.)~
@265=~*Cough* <CHARNAME> *Cough* ...~ [xalc1005]
@266=~Schael!~
@267=~That's better... come on, we need to get that.. Lanthorn.~
@268=~(She retches, and begins vomiting blood.)~
@269=~(She stumbles and falls to her hands and knees.)~
@270=~(You run over to her and she collapses into your arms.)~
@271=~What the hells is this now?~ [xalc1148]
@273=~Right *cough* *wheeze* *cough*... just before we *cough*.. left for Dragonspear...~
@274=~The Three Old Kegs, love. You had the Berduskan dark wine, your favorite.~
@275=~One day, we'll look back on this and laugh *cough* over a couple of drinks at... at... where was it...~
@276=~Ugh...~
@277=~Schael!~
@278=~Thanks *cough* come on... we'd better find Bodhi and the Lanthorn soon... before I..~
@279=~It breaks my heart to see you like this, love.~
@280=~(It's clear to you that Schael does not have much time left. You need to find and kill Bodhi, and soon, or you will lose the woman you love.)~
@282=~Hah, I look that bad, eh? You should see *cough* yourself *cough* *cough*.~
@283=~Hang in there, Schael. We're going to find Bodhi and cure you of this cursed affliction. Can you walk?~
@284=~Y-yes... come on, love.. let's go.~
@286=~A moment of your time, <CHARNAME>?~ [xalc1048]
@287=~Sure, what's on your mind?~
@288=~For you, of course.~
@289=~A moment, a smidgen, a wee bit... whatever you need.~
@290=~I've been doing a lot of thinking... about Beno. In spite of everything he did, I don't think that he should spend eternity in that damned dagger.~
@291=~Plus, with his body destroyed, he can never harm Rohma or my father ever again. If there's a way we can release his soul...~
@292=~I understand. Perhaps Cespenar knows of a way to help.~
@293=~It's worth a try. Thank you, love.~
@294=~It's worth a try. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@295=~No! You'll die *wheeze*... for threatening my family...~
@296=~I remember the wizard Melkor had mentioned something about the Fugue Plane... If we can bring the dagger to Kanaglym, he thought that it would release the souls trapped within.~
@297=~That bitch, she.. she bit me!~
@298=~You're hurt, Schael. Here, let me help you.~
@299=~Thanks... I - I just feel a bit weak...~
@300=~Jaheira? Is there anything you can you help?~
@301=~Aerie? Is there anything you can do to help?~
@302=~Viconia? Is there anything you can do to help?~
@303=~Anomen? Is there anything you can do to help?~
@304=~Take a moment to recover, love. When you're ready, we will go after Bodhi and retrieve the Lanthorn.~
@305=~Right... come on.. we need to keep moving.~
@306=~(She's up and about, but unsteady — you become concerned that her condition may deteriorate over time).~
@307=~Bodhi's Ambush
Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and wounding the one person that is dearest to my heart: Schael. Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue, I will lose even more than I thought possible. In spite of her threats, I must continue my pursuit of Bodhi and the Rhynn Lanthorn, though I am concerned that Schael's condition will worsen over time.~
@308=~Gladly, dear.~
@309=~And you?~
@312=~What is it, Major?~
@313=~Finally, it's over. Congratulations on your victory, <CHARNAME>.~
@314=~I'm heading back to Baldur's Gate. The elves were kind enough to arrange a caravan to take me home.~
@315=~What will you do now?~
@316=~Thank you, Captain.~
@317=~I'd stay and celebrate, but I can't stomach the sight of you and Viconia together any longer. Farewell.~
@318=~I'd stay and celebrate, but I can't stomach the sight of you and Hexxat together any longer. Farewell.~
@319=~I'd stay and celebrate, but I can't stomach the sight of you and Dorn together any longer. Farewell.~
@320=~I know we've had our ups and downs, but I wish you well. If you ever want to give us another try, come and see me in Baldur's Gate. Farewell.~
@321=~If what the celestial said is true though... you'd be leaving the struggle of this life, only to enter into a new struggle against gods and other planar powers. A relentless battle, for perhaps all of eternity... I can't even begin to fathom what that would be like. Will you ever find peace? Will you ever find ... love?~ [xalc1049]
@322=~You've given me a lot to think about. If I do accept this power, I promise you that at the very least, I will keep you, Rohma, and our child safe from any who would seek to do you harm.~
@323=~You've given me a lot to think about. If I do accept this power, I promise you that at the very least, I will keep you and Rohma safe from any who would seek to do you harm.~
@324=~You've given me a lot to think about. If I do accept this power, I promise you that at the very least, I will keep you, Rohma, and our children safe from any who would seek to do you harm.~
@326=~This statue makes me look like a damned troll! Look, the arms are nearly as long as the legs! And gods, that nose!~
@327=~Do you think this looks like me?~
@328=~Take it as a compliment.~ [xalc1158]
@329=~Not at all...~
@331=~This must be a tough time for you, then.~ [xalc1133]
@332=~(She tries, and fails, to stifle a laugh.)~
@333=~You have enough on your plate to deal with. No need to get wrapped up with nobility, or their power and political games.~ [xalc1202]
@336=~<CHARNAME>... what happened?~ [xalc1159]
@337=~(You notice that her skin and eye color have returned to normal.)~
@338=~You collapsed as we ran the stake through Bodhi's heart. How are you feeling?~
@339=~Ugh... help me up, will you?~
@340=~Thank goodness. I was afraid I'd lost you.~
@343=~With the Lanthorn, we can finally take the fight to Irenicus. I have a feeling that one way or the other, this will all be over, and soon. Let's go.~
@344=~Yes... I'm feeling much better. Thank you, love.~
@345=~Are you alright?~
@346=~Major, you've represented your city and your family with distinction. It has been an honor to stand at your side. Walk in the light, always.~
@347=~Thank you, Caelar. When the time comes, I'll vouch for your actions. Take care, and good luck.~
@367=~My dear... as much as I want you to make love to me...~
@368=~You really need to have those wounds looked at first.~
@369=~I really need to have these wounds looked at first.~
@370=~This bite... I'm not feeling well *cough* at all.~
@371=~I understand, love.~
@372=~Let's just try and get some rest instead.~
@374=~My love... do you have a moment?~
@375=~Of course, dear. What's on your mind?~
@376=~Not right now, Schael.~
@377=~It's important. You'll want to hear this.~
@379=~Fine (sigh), forget it.~
@380=~I've been reflecting on recent events... and the dangers we face.~ [xalc1256]
@381=~You saved my life, <CHARNAME>. I was finished after Bodhi's bite, but you saved me...~
@382=~Would you have expected any less? I love you Schael, more than anything. You know this.~
@383=~You're a valuable ally. You'd have done the same for me.~
@384=~Yes, of course.. what I mean to say is.. Gods, why is this so hard?~
@385=~Let's not let our mission, our duties, get in the way of...~
@387=~But, I thought you wanted to wait until we returned home, to Baldur's Gate.~
@388=~I agree wholeheartedly.~
@389=~It wasn't that I didn't want to... I do. It's just that I've always put my duty ahead of my own desires.~ [xalc1051]
@390=~Let me be perfectly clear. I want you, <CHARNAME>. I want you to make love to me.~ [xalc1257]
@391=~Are you saying what I think you're saying?~
@392=~That might be the most romantic thing anyone has ever said.~
@393=~Nothing would please me more.~
@394=~Hardly. But I appreciate the compliment.~
@395=~Let's take this nice and slow. Remember — maintain three points of contact at all times.~
@396=~Climb many trees in your youth, Corwin?~
@397=~Climb many trees in your youth, love?~
@398=~No, not really. We practice scaling walls during our training exercises. The principle is the same.~
@399=~Climb many trees, love? Besides mine, I mean.~
@400=~(She gives you a wry smile, and rolls her eyes.)~
@401=~That smell, ugh. It reminds me of ... it reminds me of Avernus!~
@402=~We survived that, and we'll survive this. Stand ready.~
@403=~Right.~
@404=~<CHARNAME>, that's enough! I know that they share some blame for what happened to you, but control yourself! Our fight is with Irenicus, not them!~
@405=~You're right. Sorry, love, I don't know what came over me.~
@406=~You're right. Sorry, Captain, I don't know what came over me.~
@407=~Fine. We'll do it your way. Self-righteous fools like the priestess here make me sick.~
@408=~Just keep it together, <CHARNAME>. We're so close to victory. Priestess — what do we need to do to gain entry to the palace?~
@409=~Just keep it together, my love. We're so close to victory. Priestess — what do we need to do to gain entry to the palace?~
@410=~Have you lost your mind!? How does killing these gnomes help us in the hunt for Irenicus?~
@411=~I give the orders here, Captain, not you. Follow them, or step aside!~
@412=~You're right, Captain. I'm sorry — I've not been myself since my soul was stolen from me.~
@413=~You're right, love. I'm sorry — I've not been myself since my soul was stolen from me.~
@414=~You've no idea how much this hurts. Allies, to me!~
@415=~My friend, I wish there was some way for me to help you... just keep it together. We'll find a way through this. Goldander — we'll help you.~
@422=~Hahah, wait... you *are* joking, right?~
@424=~I'm here on duty, not to pick up men... and certainly not to spend my evening with a drunkard.~
@425=~Girl, where are your parents? Do they know that you're out here turning tricks?~
@426=~Really, <CHARNAME>? Very funny.~
@427=~Ow!~
@428=~Well, she's even better than you, so yes.~
@429=~She doesn't compare to you, love. No one does.~
@430=~Let's go.~
@431=~(She becomes visibly upset.) You bastard! Gods damn it... (She calms down.)~
@432=~(She places her hand on your shoulder.)~
@433=~For just having my soul ripped out of me, yes, I feel fine.~
@434=~I'm not sure. It's hard for me to explain.... I feel... hollow?~
@435=~Whatever he did, we'll find a way to restore you and your sister.~
@436=~Right. Let's go.~
@441=~It's very simple. You're trading slaves, and we're here to shut you down. Do me a favor and resist. Please.~
@442=~To think I even considered the possibility of you and I being together. Madness. Be with Dorn, then. I want nothing more to do with you.~ [xalc1102]
@443=~H-huh? No, I'm not interested.~
@444=~As a matter of fact, I am.~
@445=~(You share a warm embrace, and steel yourself for the battle ahead.)~
@446=~The bastard is finally dead. The Council will be pleased. I know I am.~
@447=~And your soul, my love — are you feeling any differently?~
@448=~And your soul, <CHARNAME> — are you feeling any differently?~
@449=~They're dead, and you'll join them if you don't hand over Claire right now!~
@450=~Now's not the time for petty bickering. If we don't work together, none of us are making it out of here alive. Goldander — you said you knew of someone who could help us get into the city?~
@457=~(She gives him a dirty look.)~
@458=~What was that?~
@459=~It's good to see you too, Imoen. As for why I'm here, <CHARNAME> found evidence proving that Irenicus is responsible for what happened to Skie. I was assigned to assist <PRO_HIMHER> in the hunt for the wizard.~
@460=~She's alive and well, thanks to <CHARNAME>. I'll fill you in on the details later. We need to get moving.~
@461=~Aye Drizzt, I recognize that insignia on her armor. Yer far from home, aren't ye girl?~
@462=~She must be some kind of impostor. The Flaming Fist puts bandits to the sword — they don't fight alongside them!~
@463=~He's right, Drizzt. We can't be allowin' these bandits to run free... who knows what horrid acts they'll commit if we don't stop 'em?~
@464=~I'm traveling with <CHARNAME> on a special assignment to apprehend a wizard, Jon Irenicus.~
@465=~I'm Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist.~ [xalc1172]
@466=~How do I know you aren't an impostor, as my friend suggests? I know a bit of the Flaming Fist and its reporting structure. Tell me, who are your commanding officers? Answer carefully.~
@467=~Marshall Nederlok and Duke Eltan.~
@468=~I know of another in the Flaming Fist. Based on your claimed rank, you should be reporting to them.~
@469=~If you're referring to Scar, he was assassinated several months ago, as part of a plot to usurp control over the city. <CHARNAME> brought both the assassin and the usurper to justice. Scar was a good friend, and I miss him dearly.~
@470=~You say you were a friend to Scar. If you were truly his friend, you would know his real name.~
@471=~His name was Harold Loggerson.~
@472=~(His expression changes from one of suspicion to one of surprise.)~
@473=~Scar was a good man. I'm sorry to hear that he has passed. You said you were after a wizard? What has this person done to warrant the attention of the Flaming Fist?~
@474=~Yes. The wizard nearly murdered Skie Silvershield, the daughter of one of the Grand Dukes, and framed <CHARNAME> for the crime. <CHARNAME> found evidence proving <PRO_HISHER> innocence and is responsible for Skie's restoration.~
@475=~Once <PRO_HISHER> innocence was established, I was assigned to assist <PRO_HIMHER> in the hunt for the wizard.~
@476=~I see... If <CHARNAME> was framed for that crime by the wizard then... perhaps... it may also be the case that it was not <PRO_HESHE> that attacked me while I was beset by gnolls...~
@477=~You don't seriously believe them, do you?~
@478=~I do. I sense no deception from this woman, and her account of <CHARNAME>'s actions lead me to believe that <PRO_HESHE> is a force for good, not evil.~
@479=~Hold your tongue, drow. I've never known <CHARNAME> to resort to banditry. I suggest that you and your companions move along — now.~
@480=~Eh? Is she threatening us? Do you think she's serious?~
@481=~If you are in need of assistance, I'll be glad to offer it. If not, I will wish you well and we shall be on our way back to the far north.~
@482=~FINSOL01 Debug.~
@483=~I have a proposal for you, Drizzt, if you'll wait for a moment.~
@484=~Go... and thank you, love. Thank you for everything you've done for me, for Rohma, and for Baldur's Gate. Thank you for giving me children, and for the memories that I'll cherish for as long as I live. Farewell.~
@485=~Go... and thank you, love. Thank you for everything you've done for me, for Rohma, and for Baldur's Gate. Thank you for giving me a child, and for the memories that I'll cherish for as long as I live. Farewell.~
@486=~Go... and thank you, love. Thank you for everything you've done for me, for Rohma, and for Baldur's Gate... and for the memories that I'll cherish for as long as I live. Farewell.~
@487=~You threaten my daughter? You just made your last mistake!~ [xalc1149]
@488=~That adventurer we encountered, Drizzt, was adamant that you had assaulted him. Was he speaking the truth?~
@489=~I'd rather not talk about it.~
@490=~No, you know me, I'd never do such a thing.~
@491=~You don't know what it was like — assassins had already made several attempts on my life, and every day was a struggle to survive. I regret it, and I promise you that I'm not the same person that I was.~
@492=~Yes, I did, and I'd do it again. I was struggling to survive and needed his equipment.~
@493=~I see. Let's go.~
@494=~I appreciate your honesty. We've all made bad decisions — it's good though that you've learned from yours. Let's go.~
@495=~I appreciate your honesty. We've all made bad decisions — it's good though that you've learned from yours. Let's go, love.~
@496=~Sometimes I feel like I don't know you at all. I'd rather you'd have done it and been honest with me than to lie about it. Let's go.~
@497=~Yes, I did. I saw he was a drow, and everything I'd heard about his kind convinced me that he'd harm me after killing the gnolls.~
@498=~I appreciate your honesty. Let's go.~
@499=~I appreciate your honesty. Let's go, love.~
@500=~It's good to see you again, Captain, but I'm surprised that you're here.~
@501=~Skie, is she ...~
@502=~Good. Right, let's get moving.~
@503=~Now get the hells out of here!~
@504=~(Captain Corwin walks up to Lady Delcia and delivers a powerful, open-handed slap to her face that sends her crashing to the floor. Delcia looks up at Corwin, and is left quivering and speechless.)~
@505=~Now listen to me! I didn't leave my family and travel all this way only to be spoken down to by a pretentious, insufferable bitch. We aren't your servants, and you're no better than the dirt on my heel. Get up.~ [xalc1201]
@507=~I've heard enough.~
@509=~H-how... how DARE you! That's my aunt you just struck!~
@511=~(Remain silent.)~
@512=~Are you deaf, woman? Get out!~
@513=~Gods. I think she needed that as much as I did.~
@514=~It was for her own good. Anyone who runs their mouth like that to the wrong person risks an untimely death. Hopefully she learned her lesson.~
@515=~I can't believe you did that, love.~
@516=~I can't believe you did that, Corwin.~
@517=~She definitely deserved it. Well done, love.~
@518=~She definitely deserved it. Well done, Captain.~
@519=~Well said — let's get moving.~
@521=~I've just been so stressed lately...~
@522=~I know it's tough being away from your family. I'm glad you're here though. ~
@523=~You and I both... my love, I know of a couple of activities that can help us to relieve some of that stress...~
@524=~Let's finish up here, then. Afterward, I want you to find a nice place for the two of us to ... relieve some of that stress.~ [xalc1263]
@526=~I know just the place.~
@527=~What do you suggest?~
@528=~Good.~
@529=~I've been watching you, love, and of late I don't like what I see.~ [xalc1173]
@530=~What? I don't understand.~
@531=~For all of your power, your fighting skills are suspect. You're not bad with a weapon, but your hand-to-hand skills are sorely lacking. I shouldn't be surprised based on your upbringing in Candlekeep, but I'm concerned.~ [xalc1264]
@532=~You're speaking to the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who defeated Sarevok and stopped Caelar's crusade. You're clearly mistaken, love.~
@533=~Perhaps you're right. I'm open to any tips you can give me.~
@534=~You defeated them with raw power, not skill. Get us a room and I'll show you what I mean. Let's go.~
@535=~Very well. Get us a room and I'll show you what I mean. Let's go.~
@536=~You can be beaten by a seemingly lesser opponent if they recognize and exploit your lack of skill.~ [xalc1265]
@538=~Brevlik, your advocate will be with your shortly. <CHARNAME> — we better head back to the Hall of Wonders.~
@539=~Enjoy your last moments of autonomy, child.~
@540=~Very well. Lower your weapons, friends. She is telling us the truth.~
@541=~And you, young lady.~
@542=~(He looks at Corwin, and the Flaming Fist insignia on her armor.)~
@543=~I trust you are here to affect some appropriate punishment for what I did to Skie Silvershield?~
@544=~Ugh...~
@545=~(She struggles mightily, but is unable to break free of the golem's grip.)~
@546=~You won't get away with this, wizard!~
@547=~Worry not, my dear. Unlike the others, you will live past these next few minutes. Once I am done with <CHARNAME>, you'll soon be returned home, where you will assassinate the Council of Four on my behalf.~
@548=~What..? No, never!~
@549=~It's a trivial matter. You'll be enslaved just as easily as Yoshimo was. Enjoy your last moments of autonomy, child.~
@550=~It's a trivial matter. You'll be enslaved through the use of a geas. Enjoy your last moments of autonomy, child.~
@551=~Wh- oh... no! Gods!~
@552=~Release us! I'll kill you, I swear it!~
@553=~The Hall of Wonders...~
@554=~<CHARNAME>, did I ever tell you how I got arrested?~ [xalc1266]
@555=~You, arrested?~
@556=~No, I don't think you did, Captain.~
@557=~No love, I don't think you did.~
@558=~Well... it was after my mother died. My father was still a Fist at the time, so when he left for work I'd leave the house to hang out with some ... friends of mine. It's how I met Beno.~
@559=~We got ourselves into a *lot* of trouble.~ [xalc1267]
@560=~Well? Tell me more.~
@561=~Hah, some things never change. You still get into a lot of trouble, only with me instead!~
@562=~One day, we had the brilliant idea to go to the Hall of Wonders and play hot potato with a jeweled egg. It was donated to the museum by an emissary from Tethyr. It must have been worth hundreds, or even thousands of gold.~
@563=~There we were, throwing this very expensive and precious egg around, while the museum guards were frantically chasing us in and around the Hall.~
@564=~Guess who was holding the egg when the music stopped?~ [xalc1198]
@565=~You.~
@566=~That's right. My 'friends' all ran away, and I was arrested... but not before I broke the nose of one guard, and knocked down the other. As Tymora would have it, Harold — Commander Scar — was outside, and came running in after hearing all the commotion. It was he who finally managed to subdue me. It's a good thing that the egg wasn't damaged, otherwise I might still be in prison, hah.~
@567=~My father could've gotten me out like he did so many times before, but this time, he didn't — and I'm glad. Spending that night in that cold cell was a major wake up call for me.~ [xalc1197]
@568=~I know what you mean. I never want to see those cells again.~
@569=~Do you ever think of how the course of your life would've changed had you not been arrested?~
@570=~I do... Would Rohma be here? Would I have joined the Fist? Taken part in the Dragonspear campaign?~
@571=~... Would I be in love with the most amazing and heroic <PRO_MANWOMAN> in Faerûn?~
@573=~You know, sometimes I think how my life would've changed if I hadn't been arrested that day...~
@574=~Would Rohma be here? Would I have joined the Fist? Taken part in the Dragonspear campaign?~
@575=~And would I be in love with such an incredible, beautiful and determined woman?~
@576=~(You share a warm embrace.)~
@577=~Come on, let's head in. I'm sure they've set up some interesting new exhibits since the last time we were here.~ [xalc1196]
@578=~Only the Gods know, I guess...~
@579=~Fine. But you and I are going to have a long talk about this.~
@580=~(She turns, and looks at you with disappointment.)~
@581=~You — gnome! Get out of here before I change my mind!~
@582=~(She delivers a swift, powerful kick to his behind.)~
@583=~(Keep quiet.)~
@584=~I don't envy your decision. To become a god... only to enter into a new struggle against other gods and planar powers. A relentless battle, for perhaps all of eternity... I can't even begin to fathom what that would be like. Would you ever find peace? If I were in your shoes... well. I know what I'd choose.~ [xalc1268]
@585=~Whatever you decide, <CHARNAME>, I want you to know how much I appreciate everything you've done for me, for Rohma, and for Baldur's Gate. Thank you. It's been an honor to fight at your side, hero.~ [xalc1269]
@586=~You decided to send her home, instead of prison? Interesting. I'll need to let the Dukes know about this.~
@587=~You don't approve?~
@588=~Were it up to me... I think I'd have let her go too. Whatever she endured in Avernus was greater than any punishment the Fist could've doled out. I just hope that it's the last we've seen and heard of her. Let's go.~ [xalc1270]
@589=~Would you have chosen differently?~
@590=~You have a problem with that?~
@591=~You decided to send her to prison, instead of letting her go. Interesting. I'll need to let the Dukes know about this.~
@592=~I... I'm sworn to uphold the law, and Caelar deserves to be punished for what she did. In spite of that, I would've let her go. Whatever she endured in Avernus was greater than any punishment the Fist can dole out. I just hope that it's the last we've seen and heard of her. Let's go.~
@593=~(She gives you a sharp stare.)~
@594=~<CHARNAME> — what happened back there? You nearly blew our cover!~
@595=~I'm sorry. The sight of enslaved children sickens me.~
@596=~You're right... I shouldn't've lost my cool.~
@597=~Oh, right, can't forget the Eye Tyrants. But, as I was saying, if all of those beasties couldn't keep us apart, what would cause you think that the promise of godhood would? I love you Schael. All I want is a life together with you.~
@598=~Let's see... Kobolds. Crusaders. Also, Beholders, *sob* Mind Flayers, Basilisks... and who can forget the Bhaalspawn...~
@599=~(She laughs, as her eyes fill with tears of joy.)~
@600=~And you shall have it, hero.~
@601=~Back to the city, then, as soon as we can.~ [xalc1174]
@602=~Why so surprised? If evil wizards, demons, dragons, and liches couldn't keep us apart... wait, did I forget anything?~
@603=~Something bothering you?~
@604=~What manner of creature is imprisoned here?~ [xalc1200]
@605=~Bastard! You lied to us! You knew it was Demogorgon that was imprisoned the entire time!~
@606=~Justice has finally come for you, wizard. Prepare to die!~
@607=~<CHARNAME>! Oh, thank goodness...~
@608=~S-Schael...? How long was I...?~
@609=~Two days... *sob* ... h-how are you feeling?~
@610=~Good, just ... tired. A-are you crying? What happened?~
@611=~Nothing, it's just...~
@612=~Come here, love.~
@613=~(You share a tender and passionate embrace.)~
@614=~It's alright Schael, let it out. I'm here.~
@615=~And it will be, love, I *sob* promise you.~
@616=~Get some rest love. I'll check in on you later.~
@617=~Thank you Schael. For everything.~
@618=~Please, stay with me. (Take hold of her hand.)~
@619=~That was one hell of a party.~ [xalc1271]
@620=~It definitely was.~
@621=~A better liquor selection would have been nice...~
@622=~I think it'll pale in comparison to the one the city will throw for us upon our return.~ [xalc1195]
@623=~Baldur's Gate? Are they expecting us?~
@624=~They are. While you were recovering, I asked the elves to send word to the Council that Irenicus was dead, and that we'd be returning to the city soon. Gods, I can't wait to see Rohma and my father.~
@625=~Wh...What? I don't believe it. You chose to stay, instead of becoming a god?~
@626=~I never wanted any of that, Schael. All I want is a life together with you.~
@627=~Don't you remember? I told you once long ago that some stories have happy endings. I'd like for our story to be one of them, Schael.~
@628=~(She covers her mouth, as her eyes fill with tears of joy. After a moment, she regains her composure.)~
@629=~Before we go, let's check with the rest of the team to see who's coming with us. I imagine some'll want to stay here and help the elves with their wounded.~ [xalc1272]
@630=~Heh. It was tame compared to the one the coalition threw for us after Avernus.~
@632=~Let's go.~
@633=~Not yet.~
@634=~Take your time. Come and see me when you're ready.~
@635=~I'm almost there, Rohma. I'll be home soon...~ [xalc1150]
@636=~You can count me in. Oh, I can't wait to see Liia again! There are so many stories I'll share with her.~
@637=~This is where we part ways, at least for now, <CHARNAME>. Gorion would be proud of the <PRO_MANWOMAN> you've become. I'll remain here to help undo the damage that Irenicus inflicted on the Tree of Life.~
@638=~(You share a warm embrace.)~
@639=~I'll be joining you, my dear.~
@640=~This is where we part ways, at least for now, <CHARNAME>. I urge you to become the type of <PRO_MANWOMAN> that Gorion would be proud of. I'll remain here to help undo the damage that Irenicus inflicted on the Tree of Life.~
@641=~I'll join you. The sooner we can leave, the better — the surface elves are looking for an excuse to murder me, I know it.~
@642=~Oh, yes, this is a wonderful opportunity to expand my turnip business! I'll go with you.~
@643=~Back to Athkatla for me, I'm afraid. The turnips need tending to. Safe travels, my friends.~
@644=~We're in a city of magical knowledge that few humans have set foot in, and you want me to go back to that diseased backwater of a city? Bah! I'll remain here and learn the secrets of the elves. (That is, until they throw me out.)~
@645=~I would go with you, but Boo has become intensely infatuated with a squirrel that he saw on the Tree of Life. I must find this squirrel and determine if she is a worthy mate for Boo.~
@646=~(She points at Hexxat.)~
@647=~Oh, of course I will go with you! M-maybe we can also see Candlekeep? It'll be fun to see where you g-grew up.~
@648=~O-oh, I think it'll be better for me to stay here. There are still many injured, and the elves can use my help.~
@649=~T-thank you, <CHARNAME> for everything. For freeing me from the circus, and for taking me on this grand adventure. I've learned so much about the world, and.. and about m-myself. I h-hope to see you again soon.~
@650=~(You share a warm embrace.)~
@651=~This is an opportunity to understand the plight of the poor from a broader perspective. I'll go with you.~
@652=~I will remain here for a time, my sparrow. I wish to see this place restored to its former beauty. May our paths cross again in the near future.~
@653=~Aye, I'll go with ye. It hath been many a year since I traveled the Sword Coast, plus I be sick of these queers already. I'll stop at Beregost on the way and pay an old friend of mine a visit.~
@654=~I promised my wife that I would return home after putting an end to Irenicus, and I will do so. Good-bye, my friend. May Torm guide your path.~
@655=~Now that Irenicus has been dealt with, I must return to my order and my duty. Good-bye, my friend. May Torm guide your path.~
@656=~I sense that my patron wishes for us to part ways, at least for now. I have a feeling that our paths will cross again, and soon. Until then, <CHARNAME>.~
@657=~Yes, I'll go with you. Anywhere, even Baldur's Gate, is better than staying here.~
@658=~There is nothing left for me in Amn. Captain, I'd like to take you up on your offer and join the Flaming Fist, at least on an interim basis.~
@659=~Excellent — you'll make a fine addition to the team.~
@660=~No, I won't be joining you. I'm going back to my cabin in the woods. I'll use the time and seclusion to decide what to do with my life.~
@661=~Of course I'll join you silly! It'll be nice to see the Sword Coast again!~
@662=~I'm afraid I too must return to the order. Safe travels <CHARNAME>, and you as well Captain.~
@663=~I'm afraid I must decline, and return to my order. Safe travels <CHARNAME>, and you as well Captain.~
@664=~I will join you. There is little left for me in Amn, and I am eager for a fresh start.~
@665=~I will remain by your side my love, now and always.~
@666=~I will remain here for a time and help the elves repair the damage to the Tree of Life. Good-bye and safe travels, friends.~
@667=~I will remain here for a time and help the elves repair the damage to the Tree of Life, then, I will return home to raise my son. Good-bye and safe travels, friends.~
@668=~Yes my friend, I will return with you. I am interested to see what progress has been made in dealing with the refugee crisis. My help may still be needed.~
@670=~The elves were also gracious enough to provide us a caravan for the trip back. Are you ready to leave, dear?~ [xalc1324]
@671=~The elves were also gracious enough to provide us a caravan for the trip back. Are you ready to leave?~ [xalc1323]
@672=~<CHARNAME> — Take a few minutes to gather your belongings. Come and talk to me when you're ready to leave.~
@674=~Thank you, sir.~
@675=~Yes, sir.~
@676=~Corporal, I trust all is well with you? How is Skie?~
@677=~Changed? In what way?~
@678=~Understood. <CHARNAME>, let's head in. We'll stop at my place first. It's in the southeast part of the city.~ [xalc1273]
@679=~No — I still need to see my family.~
@680=~Listen, I really need to see my family. My home's in the southeast part of the city. Let's go.~ [xalc1274]
@681=~(They share a long embrace, and Schael gives her daughter a big kiss.)~
@683=~Oh, I've missed you so much!~
@684=~I missed you too mommy!~
@686=~Me too, father.~
@687=~(They share a warm embrace.)~
@688=~I see you've brought company.~
@689=~If you arrest him, you'll have to arrest me too, Captain. Let him go.~
@690=~As am I, sir.~
@691=~Corporal Duncan told us you'd be home soon. I can't tell you how much of a relief it is to have you back.~
@693=~Gods, where does the time go?~
@695=~Oh! Look what I got for you Rohma.~
@696=~(She hands her the trophy she won at the Trademeet Archery Competition.)~
@697=~Can you read me what it says?~ [xalc1275]
@698=~Winner.. eighth an-annu...~
@699=~Annual. Remember, sound it out one part at a time.~
@700=~Annual... trade..meet... ar..chery.. c-comp.. comp-e-ti-tion!~
@701=~Great job honey. Your reading has improved quite a bit.~
@703=~The individual responsible has been arrested.~
@705=~I wish you two the best. As for me, I must return to Trademeet. It was an honor to fight at your side, and I hope that our paths may cross again.~
@710=~Sir, allow me to introduce you to Valygar. He's a ranger from Amn who has expressed interest in joining the Flaming Fist. I know that he'd make a great addition to our team.~
@711=~Yes, sir.~
@712=~Rohma!~
@713=~(You think to yourself that this is the first time you'll have met Schael's family. It may be worthwhile stopping at one of the General Stores in the city to see if you can find a gift for her daughter.)~
@714=~What do you say, Rohma?~
@715=~(You think to yourself that it's been a while since you've seen Schael's family. It may be worthwhile stopping at one of the General Stores and getting a gift for her daughter.)~
@717=~I heard you'd be coming home! How are you?~
@718=~(They break into laughter.)~
@719=~Listen, I have to start my shift soon. Let's get caught up later, over a drink or two.~
@721=~(They speak amongst themselves for a time. You can't make out what they are saying.)~
@722=~Really? You and ... (she looks at you and smiles.)~
@723=~I'm so glad to be back. How're things with you?~
@724=~Sounds good. I'll see you later.~
@725=~(They hug, and Neoma leaves after giving Schael a kiss on her cheek.)~
@726=~Oh, Neoma...~
@728=~You two seem very... ah, friendly.~
@729=~Us? How many more of you are there?~
@730=~Having a famous hero around is handy, but it also seems to attract trouble.~ [xalc1175]
@731=~And I want you to, but now's not the right time...~
@737=~I'm glad you were able to see her again, love. Let's go.~
@739=~Neoma and I are friends. Sometimes a little more than that, if you know what I mean. But you're the one I love, <CHARNAME>, not her.~
@740=~Is my... friendship with Neoma going to be a problem? If so, I'll stop seeing her. I don't want anything to jeopardize the love that you and I have for one another.~
@741=~I don't know, Schael. I've never been in any kind of long term relationship, before meeting you. It's hard for me to know what's healthy for a relationship and what isn't.~
@742=~It's not a problem, so long as you don't develop any serious feelings for her.~
@743=~Problem? No — in fact, I'm... ah... intrigued by some of the ... possibilities.~
@744=~I understand. Thank you for being honest about your feelings, love. I'll tell Neoma that from now on, we're to be friends and nothing more. Let's go.~ [xalc1276]
@745=~I... see.~
@746=~And I won't. Thank you for being honest about your feelings, love. Let's go.~ [xalc1277]
@747=~(A mischievous smile graces her face.)~
@748=~Heh. Somehow, I knew you'd be. I'll see if she's interested. Let's go.~ [xalc1278]
@749=~What's your name, little girl? You said you were sent here from Baldur's Gate?~ [xalc1279]
@750=~Do you know if there are others being held here?~
@751=~Here, take this gold.~
@752=~We'll find them, don't worry. Mera, listen to me. Get out of here, then head to the Government District. Speak to Inspector Brega, and tell him everything that happened. Go, now!~
@753=~I hope those kids can make it to safety.~ [xalc1252]
@754=~Whatever happens, we've dealt a serious blow to the slavers.~
@755=~So do I.~
@756=~Every time the Fist thinks that the slaver problem is under control, we find out how wrong we are.~ [xalc1253]
@757=~I'll launch an investigation as soon as I return to the city... someone needs to make those slaver bastards pay!~
@758=~Sir, before you leave — while we were in Athkatla, we found evidence of slaver activity occurring in Baldur's Gate.~
@759=~We encountered a number of refugees from Caelar's crusade. They told us that they were shipped out of Baldur's Gate to Athkatla.~
@760=~They were told that they were being moved to new homes in other cities. Instead, when they arrived in Athkatla, the children were separated from their parents and sold to slavers. We weren't able to find the parents, though we did free the children from their captors.~
@762=~Thank you, Marshal Nederlok.~
@763=~Thank you — before you leave, while in Athkatla I found some evidence of slaver activity occurring in Baldur's Gate.~
@764=~That girl said there are at least two other children being held here. We have to find them.~
@765=~Right.~
@766=~Hopefully they're still alive.~
@767=~And so am I. Thank you, both.~
@769=~(She turns to you.)~
@770=~<CHARNAME>, I'm going to spend the rest of the day with my family. Take some time for yourself — I'm sure you have a lot of faces that you want to see. I'll see you tomorrow morning at the debriefing.~
@771=~That, and we're not making love in a gods damn stable. Let's go.~
@772=~We've already freed them. Mera, listen to me. Get out of here, then head to the Government District. Speak to Inspector Brega, and tell him everything that happened. Go, now!~
@777=~Rohma! That's enough!~
@778=~So, where're you planning to stay tonight?~
@780=~Good. Come here.~
@781=~(You share a warm embrace and kiss.)~
@782=~You definitely deserve some quality time with them.~
@783=~I was hoping to spend the night here, with you.~
@785=~Besides, Rohma's going to need some time to adjust to us being together.~
@786=~I'll stay at the Three Old Kegs tonight.~
@788=~Sounds good. You certainly have a lot of catching up to do.~
@789=~I'll stay at the Blade and Stars tonight.~
@790=~I'll stay at the Elfsong Tavern tonight.~
@791=~I'll stay at the Blushing Mermaid tonight.~
@792=~So, what'll it be?~
@793=~I understand.~
@794=~Rohma, honey — ~
@795=~I'm sorry, she's not normally this excited.~
@796=~No need to apologize.~
@797=~She's just glad to see her mommy again.~
@798=~Sweetie, come and say bye to <CHARNAME>.~
@799=~(She whispers in your ear.) I'll come see you in your room tonight, lover.~
@800=~This isn't a social visit. We're investigating reports of slaver activity in these docks, specifically, allegations that children are being shipped from here and sold into slavery. What do you know about these activities?~ [xalc1280]
@801=~Shipped from Baldur's Gate, you say? No, I don't know anything about it. We do periodic inspections of cargo on behalf of the city authorities, but we haven't come across any children.~
@802=~Now, wait a minute... A couple months back, there was a program started by some upstart noble to resettle refugees. He claimed to have connections in other cities that he used to find families willing to host them.~
@803=~He chartered a number of ships from this dock to places like Athkatla, Calimport, Waterdeep, and others.~
@804=~What's his name? Where's he now?~
@805=~I don't remember his name, but I know he and his company've set up shop in the old Iron Throne headquarters.~
@806=~Give me all of the shipping manifests for his company since the start of the refugee crisis, until now.~
@807=~I need some more time for those manifests. Give me an hour, I should have 'em ready for you by then.~
@808=~Not in an hour, now! Unless you want the Flaming Fist to turn these docks inside out.~ [xalc1281]
@809=~Right... one moment.~
@810=~Here they are. The shipping manifests for Winston Ventures for the period you mentioned.~
@811=~Thank you for your cooperation.~
@812=~Hmm.. <CHARNAME>, look. The manifests identify the company as Winston Ventures, but the contents are encoded.~
@813=~We should pay a visit to the Thieves' Guild. They may know how to decode them.~
@814=~Right. Let's go.~
@815=~That's better. You'd be well served to keep your tongue on a short leash.~
@816=~That was an entertaining distraction, but it WAS a distraction. We have work to do. Let's go.~ [xalc1146]
@817=~Good. I better not that hear that foolishness from you again.~
@818=~Good. That's what I thought.~
@819=~I see. Come with me to the Flaming Fist headquarters. I'm sure Duke Eltan would appreciate hearing how much of a fool he is for allowing the hero back into the city.~ [xalc1283]
@820=~Is that so? Duke Silvershield would love to hear more of your wisdom, citizen. Come with me. Now.~ [xalc1282]
@821=~Mind your tone, citizen! In disparaging the hero, you disrespect the Council who has exonerated them!~ [xalc1285]
@822=~The Dukes have proclaimed the hero's innocence. Do you mean to imply that they're mistaken?~ [xalc1284]
@823=~Slaver Conspiracy
I received the shipping manifests from the harbor master, but they are encoded and I cannot decipher them. Captain Corwin recommended visiting the Thieves' Guild to see if they can help decode the manifests.~
@824=~It's good to be back, sir. How have the Fist and the city fared in my absence?~ [xalc1286]
@825=~Both are doing well, thankfully. We've gained some promising new recruits, and the refugee crisis has been brought under control. Between the Iron Crisis, Sarevok, Caelar, and the situation with <CHARNAME> and Skie, it's been a rough couple of years. It's good that things've finally started to settle down.~
@826=~Have the townspeople given you or <CHARNAME> any problems?~
@827=~Most've been accepting, even welcoming. There were just a few loudmouths, but they've been straightened out.~
@828=~That's good to hear. Before I forget — Duke Eltan's tied up with some unrelated business, but he wanted me to tell you that he's glad that you and <CHARNAME> are back, and that he'll see you at the debriefing.~
@829=~Thank you sir. I'll leave you to your work.~
@830=~ I'll be fine. People like him are reminder to us that there's true, irredeemable evil in the world.~
@831=~Most've welcomed our hero with open arms.~
@832=~Very good, Captain. I'll see you at the debriefing.~
@833=~Let's pay this Winston Ventures company a visit. We might be able to find a way to decode the manifests.~
@834=~Slaver Conspiracy
I received the shipping manifests from the harbor master, but they are encoded and I cannot decipher them. Captain Corwin suggested that we head to the old Iron Throne tower, now the headquarters of the company we're investigating, to see if we could find a way to decode the manifests.~
@835=~We're here on Flaming Fist business. Let us through.~
@836=~Mera Verthan — <CHARNAME>, that's the name of the child that we rescued in Athkatla.~
@837=~That's right — Kerrachus, do you know anything else that might help?~
@838=~My love... that name, Tianna — haven't you mentioned her to me before?~
@839=~Yes... Tianna and I were seeing each other for a time. A very short time.~
@840=~I see... What happened? I mean, why'd you two break up?~
@841=~Tianna... is a user. She takes advantage of people, and their trust. The last straw was when she stole money from my family.~
@842=~It wasn't much. If she'd just asked me, I'd have given it to her. She thought she'd got away with it, but Rohma saw her.~ [xalc1010]
@843=~When she told me what Tianna did, Tianna called Rohma a liar. Like a five year old could even think to lie about something like that.~ [xalc1011]
@844=~You made the right decision.~
@845=~I just wish I'd seen what she was earlier.~ [xalc1012]
@846=~That's not someone I'd want around my child.~
@847=~It worked out in the end. You found someone better.~
@848=~(You share a warm embrace and kiss).~
@849=~Let's go, love.~
@850=~Much, much better. (She smiles.)~
@851=~Come here.~
@853=~We're here on behalf of Tianna.~
@854=~I hope you learned something from this Tianna. Next time, you might not be so lucky.~ [xalc1013]
@855=~That's a good decision. Take care of yourself.~
@856=~(They share an embrace.)~
@857=~You too, Schael.~
@858=~I've been doing a lot of thinking and... I don't think this city is a good fit for me. I'm going to take my mom south to Beregost, and try for a fresh start over there.~
@859=~Is Tianna working?~
@860=~No, that won't be necessary.~
@861=~(You hear her muttering under her breath.)~ [xalc1159]
@862=~Tianna... (sigh)~
@863=~Fine — we'll help you. <CHARNAME> and I'll talk to Jasper about forgiving your debt.~
@864=~We're working on it.~
@865=~Makes sense. Thanks for the help.~
@866=~Thanks for the help.~
@867=~Nothing, at least for now.~
@868=~My love — I imagine you have some people and places around the city that you want to see. Do you want me to come with you?~
@869=~Of course, but just for a couple of hours. You and your family deserve to spend some time with each other.~
@870=~I'd rather you stay here and enjoy some quality time with your family. You've earned it.~
@872=~Rohma, father — <CHARNAME> and I have some business to attend to. I'll be back in a couple of hours.~
@873=~I love you mommy.~
@874=~I love you, Rohma. Now, give me a hug and go to your grandfather.~ [xalc1176]
@875=~(They share a warm embrace.)~
@876=~I'll see you soon, sweetie.~
@877=~Good. Don't take too long. Rohma, say bye to mommy.~
@878=~I love you too honey. I'll be back soon, I promise.~ [xalc1014]
@879=~Oh, Rohma... I hope so. It's a big commitment.~
@880=~You know how mommy has a duty to the Flaming Fist? Well, I also have a duty to you and grandpa. A commitment is like a duty.~ [xalc1287]
@881=~It's a big duty for anyone, sweetie, but it's very rewarding at the same time.~
@882=~What's a com-it-mint?~
@883=~So being a papa is a big duty for <CHARNAME>?~
@886=~Tell <CHARNAME> he can play with my dolly if he'll be my papa.~
@887=~I will, honey. I'm sure he'd appreciate that. We'll talk some more about this when I come back.~
@888=~Be a good girl while I'm gone.~
@889=~I will, mommy.~
@890=~Thanks, father. How were things while I was away?~
@891=~Quiet, thankfully. I've been teaching Rohma some basic addition and subtraction. She's picks things up fast, like you did at her age.~
@892=~I'm not surprised. She has a great teacher.~
@893=~Hardly. Your mother, rest her soul, was much better than I am.~
@894=~Listen, Schael. I know you have strong feelings for <CHARNAME>.~
@895=~Someone of <PRO_HISHER> notoriety being around Rohma has me worried, though.~
@896=~What do you mean? <CHARNAME> would never hurt her.~
@897=~No, of course not. What I mean is that someone might use Rohma, or you for that matter, to get to <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@898=~<CHARNAME> and I discussed this on the way here... it might get complicated at times, but we're both committed to finding a way to make our relationship work. What's more, <PRO_HESHE>'s a good <PRO_MANWOMAN> father — I trust <PRO_HIMHER> with my life.~
@899=~It's good that you've had those discussions... You know, I can't remember the last time I saw you so happy and full of energy. <CHARNAME> must really love you.~
@900=~I know <PRO_HESHE> does father. And I love <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@901=~I'm glad. Well, you better get a move on then. I'll see you later.~
@902=~Right. I'll be back soon.~
@903=~<CHARNAME>, I'm going home to spend the rest of the day with my family. I'll see you tomorrow morning at the debriefing.~
@904=~My love, I'm going home to spend the rest of the day with my family. Have you decided where you're staying tonight?~
@905=~I was hoping to spend the night at your place.~
@907=~You'll do more than just see me, I hope.~
@908=~Heh... Much more. See you later.~
@910=~Skie, listen to me — put the dagger down, slowly.~
@911=~Put that damned dagger away Skie. It's gotten me into enough trouble already!~
@912=~Do as she says, Skie.~
@913=~<CHARNAME>... the caves beneath Dragonspear, remember? We encountered a rift into the Fugue plane. Hephernaan's acolytes were performing some sort of ritual there.~
@914=~Catatonia? But... we were told she'd made a full recovery.~
@915=~Very good. This is exactly what we need to prove Winston's guilt. <CHARNAME>, let's take this to Marshal Nederlok.~
@916=~It's a nice night. Let's take a walk.~
@917=~At this hour? What do you have in mind?~ [xalc1288]
@918=~(Propose to her.) You'll see. Afterwards, I'll walk you home. Let's go, love.~
@920=~Mm. That was delicious.~ [xalc1177]
@921=~It was. You ready for another drink?~
@922=~No, thanks. Two was enough. Work in the morning, you know?~
@923=~So, love. Tell me — how's life in the Ducal palace?~
@924=~Good... It'll be better though once the three of you move in.~
@925=~I don't doubt it. You've been great with Rohma... She's adjusted well to our being together, I think.~ [xalc1015]
@926=~I'm just about settled in.~
@927=~Right.~
@929=~Just about? It's been a month since you moved in. How long does it take?~ [xalc1289]
@930=~Well Schael... it's a bit lonely, to be honest. It won't feel like home until the three of you move in.~
@931=~Would that I could say the same about your father.~
@932=~Oh, don't mind him. He's that way to everyone, though he's warming up to you.~
@933=~You think so?~
@934=~I do. He told me that he liked the speech that you gave at the Hall of Wonders the other day. The one about your experiences in Amn.~
@935=~Oh, really? I'm glad. ~
@936=~It's getting late, love. I should head home.~ [xalc1016]
@937=~Speaking of work, how's Valygar? I heard he took Marshal Nederlok up on his offer to join the Flaming Fist.~
@938=~He's doing well. He got his first arrest a few days ago. Breaking and entering.~
@939=~I'm glad to hear it.~
@940=~I'll walk you home.~
@941=~A hero, and a gentleman. Let's go.~
@942=~Let's go.~
@943=~So, my friend. Tell me — how's life in the Ducal palace?~
@944=~Just about. It's a big adjustment from what we're used to.~
@945=~I'm just about settled in... it's just a big difference than what I'm used to.~
@946=~Are you and Anomen settled in?~
@947=~Are you and Aerie settled in?~
@948=~Are you and Jaheira settled in?~
@949=~Are you and Neera settled in?~
@950=~I don't doubt it.~

@952=~And you, Schael? How are you and Rohma adjusting to being together again?~
@953=~It's been great... speaking of... look at the time. I should get going.~
@954=~The stars... they're beautiful tonight...~ [xalc1178]
@955=~<CHARNAME>?~
@956=~I was just remembering when we first met.~
@957=~It is beautiful... but its beauty pales in comparison to your own, Schael.~
@958=~I remember... it's only been what, a little over a year? At the same time... I feel like we've known each other for much, much longer.~
@959=~I feel the same way. We've been through so much together. Schael, I...~
@960=~What is it, love?~
@961=~(Get down on one knee, and present her with the engagement ring.)~
@962=~Sweet of you to say. You're not too hard on the eyes yourself, dear.~
@963=~(As she turns to you, her face is illuminated by the soft, pale moonlight. She has never looked more strikingly beautiful to you, and you're momentarily taken aback.)~ [xalc1159]
@964=~W-what are you.. oh.. my..~
@965=~Schael, my love. Will you marry me?~
@966=~I know how difficult it is, but we mustn't lose focus given what's at stake. Let's go.~
@967=~Do you like it?~
@968=~I love it... it's perfect. And I love you. More than you'll ever know.~ [xalc1353]
@969=~Yes! Yes of course I will!~
@970=~(You stand, and you quickly pull each other into a long and very passionate embrace.)~
@971=~Hold out your hand, love. (Place the ring onto her finger.)~
@972=~I love you too, Schael.~
@973=~I know it's late, but come home with me. I want to tell Rohma the good news!~ [xalc1024]
@974=~Of course, my dear. Let's go.~
@975=~Father!~
@976=~...uhnnn... S-Schael...~
@977=~What happened! Where's Rohma!?~
@978=~They broke in.... t-took her...~
@979=~Who took her!?~
@981=~Avernus. What in Tymora's name were we thinking, coming back here? We must have a death wish.~
@982=~We'll be out of here as soon as we find Caelar. Stay alert.~
@983=~It was B-Beno... and a... a woman... trade Rohma... for <CHARNAME>...~
@984=~Oh, Gods! <CHARNAME>, I can't pull the spike or he'll bleed out!~
@985=~Huh? The front door is open.~
@986=~Were you expecting guests?~
@987=~No.. it looks like it was broken into..~
@988=~Oh, Gods! Rohma! Father!~
@989=~(She runs inside, and you follow in after her.)~
@990=~(Audamar lies on the floor, bloodied and severely beaten.)~
@991=~Beno...~ [xalc1000]
@992=~(She quivers, then screams in rage.)~
@993=~Schael! We'll get Rohma back, just try and calm down — Audamar, they said they'd trade Rohma for me. Did they tell you where they'd make the exchange?~
@994=~WILL I NEVER BE RID OF HIM!? UGH!!~
@995=~Stay with your father. I'll get help. Hang in there, Audamar!~
@996=~Major, your father is going to be fine. I believe he'll make a full recovery.~
@997=~Oh, thank goodness.~
@998=~Let us now discuss the matter at hand...~
@999=~Kent — read for us again the letter recovered from Audamar.~
@1000=~Yes sir. It reads as follows:~
@1001=~"<CHARNAME>, son of Bhaal. Illasera of the Five requests your presence in the Undercity, in the temple of the father. You and Major Corwin are to come, alone. If anyone else follows you, the child will die. 
Do not keep us waiting for long."~
@1002=~"<CHARNAME>, daughter of Bhaal. Illasera of the Five requests your presence in the Undercity, in the temple of the father. You and Major Corwin are to come, alone. If anyone else follows you, the child will die. 
Do not keep us waiting for long."~
@1003=~The Five... I've read reports of a such a group causing havoc in the vicinity of Saradush.~
@1004=~(She gives <GABBER> a sharp stare.)~
@1005=~We nearly blew our cover back there.~ [xalc1319]
@1006=~Rein it in. If you can't control yourself, you're a danger to us all.~ [xalc1073]
@1007=~Yes. He's Rohma's father, as distasteful as it sounds.~
@1009=~You'll almost certainly be walking into a trap. It'd be better to send some additional support, perhaps a platoon of Valiants —~
@1010=~No! Forgive me sir, but you saw the letter. I can't risk my daughter being harmed.~ [xalc1025]
@1011=~That bodes well for your daughter, then. I doubt that he'd wish to see her harmed.~
@1013=~Schael is right. We need to go after them, alone.~
@1014=~I'll go after them, alone.~
@1015=~I can't let you do that!~
@1016=~Schael, I want you by my side, but not if you're emotionally compromised. The risk to Rohma would be too great.~
@1017=~Schael, if you're to come with me, I need you calm, cool and collected — for Rohma's sake. Can I count on you?~
@1018=~What?! No.. you're right... I'm letting my feelings get the better of me. I need to focus. For Rohma.~
@1019=~Damn it!~
@1020=~I'm ready, <CHARNAME>. You can count on me, I promise you.~
@1021=~Good. Let's go get Rohma.~
@1022=~<CHARNAME>... this ring...~
@1023=~You've enough money that you don't need to work ever again.~
@1024=~That's your money. Consider it compensation for everything you've had to endure.~ [xalc1320]
@1025=~It's as much yours, Schael, as it is mine... I wouldn't be here were it not for your efforts in securing my release.~
@1026=~Even if it were my money, I'd probably keep working, at least for a while longer. Rohma needs to understand the value of hard work.~
@1027=~Besides, I haven't given up on making Colonel one day.~ [xalc1027]
@1028=~Nor should you. Colonel Corwin... I think I like the sound of that.~
@1030=~(She begins to slowly breathe in and out. You recognize this as the breathing exercise that Rasaad taught her in Amn.)~
@1031=~My love, I want you by my side, but not if you're emotionally compromised. The risk to Rohma would be too great.~
@1032=~If you're to come with me, I need you calm, cool and collected — for Rohma's sake. Can I count on you, love?~
@1033=~What are we waiting for, then!? Let's go!~
@1034=~(She smiles.)~
@1035=~Colonel? Seems a bit bureaucratic to me.~
@1036=~You think so?~
@1037=~You've always struck me as more of a 'hands-on' type of person.~
@1038=~Maybe... but being so close to the action for so long has a tendency to shorten one's lifespan...~ [xalc1321]
@1039=~I've think you've shown that you can handle whatever comes your way, Schael.~
@1040=~Sitting in an office all day? You'll get bored.~
@1050=~You mean to turn Beno against Illasera? It won't work! He's only ever cared for himself.~
@1052=~He won't stick his neck out for anyone, not even his own daughter — I'm sure of it.~
@1055=~What did the healers say? Is my father going to be alright?~
@1066=~That went well, don't you think?~ [xalc1028]
@1067=~Me too. You did a great job recounting the events.~
@1068=~I don't know... they seemed fearful of 'The Slayer'.~
@1069=~You can control that power now, and that's what matters. What happened in Spellhold, when you lost control... it can never happen again.~
@1070=~And it won't. I promise you.~
@1071=~You're right. If it did, not even your pleading on my behalf would save me. Not like last time.~
@1072=~That's for damn sure.~ [xalc1029]
@1074=~Although... I noticed you did leave *some* things out.~
@1076=~Thanks. I keep a journal whenever I'm deployed. It helps a lot when I need to deliver reports to my superiors.~ [xalc1030]
@1078=~I recall you smacking some sense into Nalia's aunt.~
@1079=~Like what?~
@1080=~Hahah... no, love, those precious memories are for *our* enjoyment only.~
@1081=~Besides the mention of my transformation, yes, I thought it went well. You did a great job recounting the events.~
@1082=~Our, ah, adventures in the bedroom. Especially that one time we kept the entire inn from getting any sleep.~
@1083=~You competed in the Trademeet Archery Competition, and you won! You were amazing, Schael.~
@1084=~Oh, right. 'Lady' Delcia, the pretentious bi—~
@1085=~(She catches herself.)~
@1086=~Never mind. I won't use that kind of language within earshot of the city officials.~ [xalc1290]
@1087=~(She looks at you with a quizzical expression.)~
@1088=~(She smiles.)~
@1089=~I appreciate that. It just wasn't pertinent to the discussion.~
@1090=~And... I look forward to making more of those kinds of memories with you, my dear.~
@1091=~I thought you'd tell them about the time you were nearly transformed into a vampire, by Bodhi.~
@1092=~Yes, well... honestly...~
@1093=~If I'd told them, it'd only be a matter of time before my father, and Rohma, would hear about it. I'd rather not trouble them with the knowledge of how close I was to turning into a monster.~ [xalc1017]
@1094=~...But I haven't forgotten how you saved me, <CHARNAME>. And I never will.~ [xalc1018]
@1095=~And I'll never forget what you did for me, Schael. My corpse would still be hanging from Entar's gallows were it not for you.~
@1096=~(You share a warm embrace.)~
@1097=~There was one other thing...~
@1098=~Hm. I wonder what they're discussing...~
@1099=~It might be a while. As you've learned by now, the Dukes are, ehh, well-known for their long deliberations.~
@1100=~Let's take a seat on the couch over here. Hopefully it's as comfortable as it looks.~
@1101=~(You and Captain Corwin take a seat, and pass the time with idle chit-chat. Minutes slowly turn to hours...)~
@1102=~Actually, it's nothing... I wonder what they're discussing...~
@1103=~Thank you, Skie! <CHARNAME>, you must be thrilled!~
@1104=~I'm still at a loss for words.~
@1105=~This turned out far better than I could've dreamed...~
@1106=~I can hardly believe it myself. You're going to do great in your new role...~
@1107=~Come on love! Let's go and celebrate!~
@1108=~(You kiss and embrace.)~
@1109=~Drinks are on me, Capt - I mean, Major!~
@1110=~Defender of Baldur's Gate. Well done, my friend.~
@1111=~Defender of Baldur's Gate. Well done, my love.~
@1112=~Come on! Let's go get Aerie and celebrate!~
@1113=~Come on! Let's go get Jaheira and celebrate!~
@1114=~Come on! Let's go get Neera and celebrate!~
@1115=~Come on! Let's go get Valygar and celebrate!~
@1116=~Come on! Let's go get Anomen and celebrate!~
@1117=~Come on! Let's go and celebrate!~
@1118=~The Undercity... They must be nearby.~
@1119=~Look at this ... I count at least five distinct sets of tracks. They lead toward the temple.~ [xalc1019]
@1120=~Let's go.~
@1121=~We should scout around first. Stay alert.~
@1122=~Right.~
@1123=~Rohma!~
@1124=~What've you done to my daughter!?~
@1125=~Beno, how could you! I'm going to —~
@1126=~Love Conquers All
Schael has asked that I get us a room at one of the inns in Amn. I can hardly contain my excitement!~
@1127=~<CHARNAME>, you must be thrilled!~
@1130=~That won't be necessary. We only need the one.~
@1131=~Schael is right. Once Rohma is safe, we'll put an end to Illasera, Beno, and anyone else that had a part in the kidnapping.~
@1132=~The man with the scar on his neck is Beno.~
@1133=~Skie, do you think you can sneak Rohma out of there?~
@1134=~How'd you get in there without them detecting you?~
@1135=~One of the city wizards gave us this ring. If you slip it on to Rohma's finger, she'll be teleported to safety.~ [xalc1020]
@1136=~(Skie takes the ring from Schael.)~
@1137=~Skie, whatever you do, don't put it on. You'll be teleported. You MUST place it on Rohma's finger.~
@1138=~We won't tell. Just be careful.~
@1139=~Skie, do you think you can get to Rohma without being seen?~
@1140=~Glint, do you think you can get to Rohma without being seen?~
@1141=~You wouldn't need to move her... One of the city wizards gave us this ring. If you slip it on to Rohma's finger, she'll be teleported to safety.~ [xalc1021]
@1142=~That's the last of them...~
@1143=~Rohma... thank Tymora that Skie got her out in time.~
@1144=~(Glint takes the ring from Schael.)~
@1145=~Glint, whatever you do, don't put it on. You'll be teleported. You MUST place it on Rohma's finger.~
@1146=~Not for long.~
@1147=~What is killing him again going to solve?~
@1148=~Wait!~
@1149=~Do your worst.~
@1150=~What is it?~ [xalc1088]
@1151=~Never mind — do your worst.~
@1152=~Rohma... thank Tymora that Glint got her out in time.~
@1154=~I have the Soultaker dagger. I'll do the deed. It's the only way you'll be free of him for good.~
@1156=~You want to me to show him mercy? He nearly got Rohma killed, and what he did to my father...~
@1157=~Kill him, and his friends will just resurrect him. Before long, he'll do this to you again.~
@1158=~But, no! I can't just let him...~
@1159=~(She lets out a long sigh.)~
@1160=~You're right. I'm letting my anger cloud my judgment. I'm an officer of the law, and I need to hold myself to a higher standard.~
@1161=~Come on. Help me get him up. We'll take him into custody together.~
@1162=~Gladly.~
@1163=~You're right... You have the Soultaker dagger. Give it to me, I'll do the deed. It's the only way you'll be free of him for good.~
@1164=~The dagger...~
@1165=~(Her expression turns to one of concern, as she deliberates internally on what to do.)~
@1168=~You're right... I have the Soultaker dagger. I'll do the deed. It's the only way we'll be free of him for good.~
@1169=~You're right... I have the Soultaker dagger. I'll do the deed. It's the only way you'll be free of him for good.~
@1170=~My love...~
@1171=~<CHARNAME>...~
@1172=~No... You've been forced into enough killing already. Hand me the dagger.~ [xalc1179]
@1174=~(You hand her the dagger.)~
@1175=~I appreciate that you're willing to do this for me, but it's my responsibility.~
@1176=~For everything... not just for today, but... for everything...~
@1177=~(Steely-faced, she takes a deep breath and approaches her former lover.)~
@1179=~No... You've been forced into enough killing already.~ [xalc1180]
@1180=~Love, you want to me to show him mercy? He nearly got Rohma killed, and what he did to my father...~
@1181=~No, I'm sorry. No mercy.~
@1182=~You have the Soultaker dagger. Give it to me, I'll do the deed. It's the only way you'll be free of him for good.~
@1183=~You have the Soultaker dagger. Give it to me, I'll do the deed. It's the only way we'll be free of him for good.~
@1184=~Any last words?~ [xalc1031]
@1185=~To hells with you, and your father!~
@1186=~(She plunges the dagger into his heart. His mouth opens as if to cry in pain, but strangely, no sound is heard. A gray mist rises out of the gaping wound in his chest, and coalesces into the form of a man; it's Beno, you're sure of it.)~
@1187=~(For a brief moment, the spirit gazes down at its physical body, with a look of wonder and confusion. That confusion turns to terror as the spirit is slowly drawn into the blade of the dagger. The spirit turns as if to flee, but it is no use. You hear a piercing scream in your mind as the last remnants of the spirit are swallowed up by the dagger.)~
@1189=~It was the only way. He'll never trouble us again. Come — I'm sure Rohma is eager to see you, my love.~
@1190=~It was the only way. He'll never trouble you or your family again. Come — I'm sure Rohma is eager to see you.~
@1191=~Right. Let's go.~ [xalc1136]
@1192=~(She picks up Beno's rusted scimitar, and, after a moment of hesitation, brings it down sharply upon his neck. The first blow did not fully sever the head from the body, and you hear a grotesque gurgling sound as Beno struggles to breathe. The second blow mercifully finishes the job. Beno's head hits the ground with a satisfying thud, then rolls a couple of feet away from his body.)~
@1193=~(Schael walks over to the now detached head, picks it up, and places it into her pack.)~
@1195=~Are you alright? That couldn't have been easy for you, love.~
@1196=~I'll be fine once I see Rohma. Let's go.~ [xalc1032]
@1197=~Are you alright? That couldn't have been easy for you.~
@1198=~Schael... I'm sorry.~
@1199=~What?~
@1200=~I'm glad one of us is enjoying this.~
@1201=~(She lets out a long sigh.)~
@1202=~No. This is wrong. Killing you, again, isn't going to solve anything. I've at least learned that much.~
@1203=~Beno, you're under arrest for the crimes of kidnapping and attempted murder.~
@1204=~<CHARNAME> — help me get him on his feet. We'll take him into custody together.~
@1205=~Gladly, Schael.~
@1206=~Beno Famari
The spirit of Beno Famari has been imprisoned in the Soultaker Dagger. It's a fitting punishment for what he did to Rohma and Audamar. He'll never harm anyone again.~
@1207=~Beno Famari
Corwin has beheaded Beno. It's a fitting punishment for what he did to Rohma and Audamar. He'll never harm anyone again.~
@1208=~Beno Famari
Corwin has arrested Beno Famari for kidnapping and attempted murder. Hopefully, he'll spend the rest of his life behind bars.~
@1210=~(They share a warm embrace, and Schael gives her daughter a kiss.)~
@1211=~Are you alright?~
@1212=~How's grandpa doing?~
@1213=~(You share a warm and tender embrace.)~
@1214=~Yes, honey?~
@1215=~Oh, where are my manners. Thank you for looking after her, Skie.~
@1216=~Oh, where are my manners. Thank you for looking after her, Duchess Jannath.~
@1217=~Of course, Major. She's such a delightful child!~
@1218=~Hmph. Just try and stay out of trouble.~
@1219=~The man with the scar is Beno. The woman has got to be Illasera.~
@1221=~I'm sure, my love. I can't risk losing you.~
@1222=~I'm sure. The city can't risk losing the both of us.~
@1223=~I'm going with you. Don't try and talk me out of it.~ [xalc1181]
@1225=~Right. I need you by my side.~
@1226=~As much as I want you to, your family, and this city, need you to protect them.~
@1227=~Whatever he did, we'll find a way to restore you and your sister. Let's go.~
@1228=~Marshal Nederlok, sir.~
@1229=~Granted. Do whatever is necessary to ensure the success of this mission. The fate of the city, and perhaps the entire Sword Coast, may depend on it.~
@1230=~(You share a warm embrace.)~
@1231=~Come here.~
@1232=~Right...~
@1233=~I'll fill you in on the way. We need to get moving.~
@1235=~Fine... Just be careful out there, please.~
@1236=~Fine... Just be careful out there, please. I can't bear to lose you.~
@1237=~Yes mommy.~
@1238=~Mommy?~
@1239=~I'm glad to have been able to help.~
@1240=~Thanks for the help back there.~ [xalc1035]
@1241=~Are you sure you're alright, love?~
@1242=~Are you sure you're alright, Captain?~
@1243=~A few cracked ribs, but it's nothing that a healer and a nice, hot bath can't fix... What happened while I was out?~ [xalc1033]
@1245=~That golem sure gave you a good squeeze.~
@1246=~Nothing. Just the small matter of having my soul ripped out of my body. Imoen suffered the same.~
@1247=~What!?~ [xalc1034]
@1248=~It's done. Thank the gods.~ [xalc1151]
@1249=~I just hope we've done the right thing.~
@1250=~He's going to be fine — the healers said that he'll be up and about in the morning.~
@1251=~Rohma's been doing a great job looking after him, haven't you dear?~
@1253=~Yep!~
@1254=~What did they do to you? Did they hurt you?~
@1255=~The healers said that she was put into a deep sleep, but that she wasn't harmed.~
@1256=~Once they woke her up, she wanted to see her grandpa right away.~
@1257=~Good, he's taking a nap. Why does he snore so loud?~
@1258=~What is it, Major?~
@1259=~Request permission to accompany <CHARNAME> to Saradush.~
@1260=~Yes, sir.~
@1261=~And Major — don't worry about your family while you're gone. We'll make sure they are well-protected here in the palace, just in case the Five try anything again. Good hunting.~ [xalcrb00]
@1262=~Thank you, sir.~ [xalc1182]
@1263=~Glint, do you think you can sneak Rohma out of there?~
@1265=~Schael — I really appreciate you doing this. I know it's not easy for you to be away from your family.~
@1266=~It never is, but... you heard Nederlok, and the Dukes. The success of this mission is essential to the safety of this city. And that includes Rohma, and my father.~
@1267=~Plus, I'd drive myself crazy if I had to stay here while the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I love was out risking <PRO_HISHER> life in some faraway land.~
@1268=~I imagine that's how Rohma and your father feel about you.~
@1269=~I know... it's definitely not easy for them, either.~
@1270=~Speaking of Rohma, it's late, and I need to put her to bed.~
@1271=~Let's break the news to her together, first.~
@1272=~I'd feel the same way if our roles were reversed, love.~
@1273=~I know, dear... it's not easy for Rohma or my father either.~
@1274=~Right...~
@1275=~You're right. The skill and counsel you've provided have proven invaluable, and I've need of them once again.~
@1276=~I will. I'll come back to you, my love — I promise.~
@1278=~It's late... I need to get Rohma to bed.~
@1279=~I'll come with you.~
@1280=~I'm glad that you chose me for this new assignment.~ [xalc1036]
@1282=~I've learned to rely on your skill and counsel, my friend.~
@1283=~It was a difficult decision.~
@1284=~How so?~
@1285=~I know it's not easy for you to be away from your family.~
@1286=~I need you Schael, more than anything. You know that.~
@1287=~This is going to be dangerous. You might get hurt, or worse.~
@1288=~Really? I thought you might be upset.~
@1290=~It is, but... it's worth the risk.~
@1291=~You heard Nederlok, and the Dukes. The success of this mission is essential to the safety of this city. And that includes Rohma, and my father.~
@1292=~And I need you. I'd drive myself crazy if I had to stay here while the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I love was out risking <PRO_HISHER> life in some faraway land.~
@1293=~And all of us here rely on you. I'd drive myself crazy if I had to stay here while the hero of Baldur's Gate was in some faraway land, risking <PRO_HIMHER>self to protect us.~
@1294=~And for that thing that ah.. we won't talk about.~
@1295=~Better do what she says, lady. Trust me.~
@1296=~Forgive me, Nalia.~
@1297=~<CHARNAME>?~
@1298=~We could use their help.~
@1299=~Thank you for the offer, Drizzt, but we aren't in need of any assistance.~
@1306=~You alright?~ [xalc1111]
@1307=~You look like you've seen a ghost.~ [xalc1037]
@1308=~(She looks at the statue the townsfolk erected in her image.)~
@1309=~I... I'm fine... ~
@1310=~Honey, what's wrong? You can tell me.~
@1311=~Alatos ... when he brought up the tunnels beneath the city ... it all came flooding back, Schael.~
@1312=~I understand... it was a traumatic experience, for all of us.~
@1313=~It's nothing... come on, let's go.~
@1314=~I think about it, still. Not as much as I used to, but... it's scary to think how close you were to... how close we were to —~
@1315=~(She turns to look at the statue the townsfolk made of you.)~
@1316=~I know, love. Come here.~
@1317=~(You share a long and tender embrace.)~
@1318=~Thank you, Schael... For believing in me, and for believing in us.~
@1319=~We have each other... and we have Rohma. The new memories we make together will drown out those dark echoes. You'll see.~ [xalc1038]
@1321=~I look forward to it.~
@1322=~Really, it's nothing. Let's get moving.~
@1323=~It's as much yours, Schael, as it is mine. You could've killed me during my escape. Instead, you showed mercy.~
@1324=~Agreed.~
@1325=~Have I killed before? Yes — but never in cold blood. Never without cause.~ [xalc1183]
@1326=~Rohma...~ [xalc1184]
@1327=~Whatever that thing was, it wasn't your daughter.~
@1328=~Rohma's safe and sound, love. That wraith was trying to rattle your cage, that's all.~
@1329=~You're right, I know... it was hard though to see that kind of burning hatred in her eyes. I... wasn't prepared for that.~
@1330=~These monsters can somehow sense our worst fears, and use them against us. Stay on your guard. Let's move.~
@1333=~We could use that to our advantage.~
@1334=~I see...~
@1335=~(She leans in.)~
@1336=~... of our intimacy.~
@1337=~Her name sounds familiar... oh, right — the earrings for Voghiln!~
@1338=~Hah, I'm surprised you remember.~
@1339=~As if I didn't hang on your every word, love.~
@1340=~Beautiful earrings for an even more beautiful woman. I remember.~
@1341=~She was a little upset when I told her I gave them away, but when I explained why, she understood.~ [xalc1039]
@1342=~Well... as long as your flings with her are a thing of the past...~
@1343=~They are. Come here.~
@1344=~(You kiss and embrace).~
@1345=~Right. Thank you, Schael.~
@1346=~Let's not let any past relationships jeopardize our love for one another.~
@1347=~(She smiles)~
@1348=~Sweet of you to say.~ [xalc1040]
@1349=~Hey — you alright?~ [xalc1325]
@1363=~Hall of Wonders
Captain Corwin shared with me the story of how she was arrested in the Hall of Wonders. The arrest changed the course of her life for the better, and helped to forge her into the woman she is today.~
@1364=~Curator Magda! It's good to see you, too.~
@1365=~How is Rohma? And your father?~
@1366=~They are well ma'am, thank you.~
@1367=~We're going to see them shortly.~
@1368=~Ah, good. And who're you? I don't believe we've met.~
@1369=~Curator Magda, allow me to introduce you to <CHARNAME>, the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@1370=~We're not paying for stolen merchandise, gnome. Hand it over, or I'll have you arrested.~
@1371=~Not so fast. You're under arrest, for grand larceny.~
@1372=~If you arrest him, you'll have to arrest me too, love. Let him go.~
@1373=~For many years... enough time to watch the Captain here grow from a rapscallious child into the fine young woman she is today.~
@1374=~(She blushes.)~
@1375=~Oh! <CHARNAME>, Captain — a number of troubled youths from the orphanage are visiting the High Hall of Wonders, as we speak. It would mean the world to them if you can take some time out of your day to give them some words of encouragement.~
@1376=~Lead the way, Curator Magda.~
@1377=~Excuse us, ma'am.~
@1378=~(She pulls you aside.)~
@1379=~What's the problem? They're orphans — they have nothing. A few words from you could at least give them some inspiration.~ [xalc1326]
@1380=~Public speaking isn't my forte... but I'll do it for you, dear.~
@1381=~If it's just a few words, then fine.~
@1382=~That's better. Lead the way, Curator Magda.~
@1383=~... ... so you see, even the smallest act of kindness can have a profound impact.~
@1387=~<CHARNAME> has horns, you dummy.~
@1388=~Yeah! And a tail!~
@1389=~With spikes!~
@1390=~And when <PRO_HESHE> breathes, smoke comes out of <PRO_HISHER> nose!~
@1391=~That's enough, all of you. Whatever rumors you've heard are untrue. This ...~
@1392=~(She gestures to you.)~
@1393=~... is *definitely* <CHARNAME>. Show a little respect!~
@1394=~Prove it!~
@1396=~And <PRO_HESHE>'s so ugly, that if <PRO_HESHE> looks at you, you turn to stone!~
@1397=~Sir, before you depart —~
@1399=~Of course, sir. Also, while in Athkatla, we encountered the fugitive Neb. I'm pleased to inform you that he's been brought to justice.~ [xalc1327]
@1400=~It'll be ready in the morning, sir.~
@1402=~<CHARNAME>, Captain, I'm so sorry about thi—~
@1403=~While in Athkatla, we located the fugitive, Neb. I'm pleased to inform you that he's been brought to justice.~
@1406=~That was wonderful, Captain. Thank you for sharing your experience with us today.~
@1407=~Children? Do you have any questions for Captain Corwin?~
@1408=~Who's the guy standing next to you?~
@1409=~This is <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate and the Sword Coast!~
@1410=~Ah, yes Hans, go ahead.~
@1411=~He's gracefully agreed to share with you some words of encouragement.~
@1412=~She's gracefully agreed to share with you some words of encouragement.~
@1413=~Who's the lady standing next to you?~
@1415=~(She looks at you with a knowing smile.)~
@1416=~Normally I'd be against it, but it might be good to scare some sense into these kids.~ [xalc1328]
@1419=~Right. (Transform into the Slayer).~
@1420=~On second thought, no. Curator Magda — we really must get going.~
@1421=~Are we — are we still trapped?~
@1422=~I think so, Schael. Look — it seems to be a recreation of the siege.~
@1423=~This all seems so real... it's just how I remember it, except for — WHOA!~
@1424=~We'd do well to avoid drawing the attention of that beast. Come on, let's head in.~
@1425=~I think so, Captain. Look — it seems to be a recreation of the siege.~
@1426=~Ma'am, did you report these disappearances to the Flaming Fist?~
@1429=~Well? Go on.~
@1430=~Ahh... forget I said anything. You have enough on your mind already. Let's go.~
@1431=~(She smiles.)~
@1432=~Seeing my cell again... it all came flooding back, Schael.~
@1433=~I think about it, still. Not just my exile, but how close I was to being —~
@1445=~And I'd rather you be open with me. Fine. Let's go.~
@1447=~(You help her back to her feet. She appears to be in very bad shape. Her eyes are bloodshot, she's covered in sweat, and her skin is pale and cold to the touch.)~
@1449=~So am I... look at me complaining. You've been through the ringer and you keep moving forward. You'd have made a great officer, you know.~
@1450=~Doubtful, but I appreciate the sentiment. Let's get going.~
@1451=~And I may still. Who knows what the future holds in store for us? Let's get going.~
@1452=~Right... We have work to do. Let's go.~ [xalc1185]
@1453=~With you as my commander? Sounds intriguing — I bet you'd *love* ordering me around, wouldn't you hon?~

@1455=~I would. But not as much as you'd enjoy it.~ [xalc1354]
@1456=~Get us a room, love, and we'll see how good you are at following orders.~ [xalc1355]
@1457=~Yes, ma'am!~
@1458=~Is that so?~
@1459=~Judging by how ... long ... and firmly ... you stood at attention the last time we were together... yes.~
@1460=~But enough distractions, lover — we've work to do. Let's get to it.~
@1461=~Well you did ... ahh ... gush with exuberance the last time we were together. Multiple times, if I remember correctly.~
@1469=~(She punches you in the shoulder.)~
@1470=~Captain as we discussed, I will return with you to Baldur's Gate to join the Flaming Fist.~
@1471=~Excellent! You won't regret it. When we arrive, I'll introduce you to my commanding officer, Marshal Kirill Nederlok.~
@1472=~We need to talk.~ [xalc1152]
@1473=~What's on your mind, love?~
@1474=~What's on your mind, Major?~
@1475=~This isn't a good time.~
@1476=~No, this is the perfect time.~
@1477=~You allowed Sarevok, of all people, to join us. I've learned to trust your judgment, but I can't help thinking that you've made a grave mistake.~
@1478=~I understand your concerns, and I share them to some extent. He has paid for his crimes, however.~
@1479=~The truth is, you're probably right. I don't trust him, but we need his strength and his knowledge.~
@1480=~Maybe ... but how many more innocents will suffer, now that he's returned? Men like him never change — he'll always be a bloodthirsty maniac.~
@1481=~Everyone deserves a second chance. Even Sarevok.~
@1482=~I'll keep him on a short leash, don't worry.~
@1483=~That's why I need you to keep an eye on him. If there's any indication of betrayal, you need to let me know immediately. He's died by my hand once, and he shall do so again if the need arises.~
@1486=~We need to keep our eyes on him at all times. If I get any sense that he's going to break his word, I swear I'll —~
@1490=~I appreciate your vigilance.~
@1491=~Not if I kill him first.~
@1492=~Right. Let's go.~ [xalc1136]
@1493=~Major, I have to believe that people can change, that they can forge a new destiny. If not, I'm doomed to follow in my father's footsteps.~
@1494=~Schael, I have to believe that people can change, that they can forge a new destiny. If not, I'm doomed to follow in my father's footsteps.~
@1495=~I ... I understand where you're coming from. I didn't mean to imply that you were anything like him, love.~
@1496=~I ... I understand where you're coming from. I didn't mean to imply that you were anything like him.~
@1497=~But I am like him. Were it not for the actions of Gorion in rescuing me, who is to say that I'd not have ended up the same as him? Who is to say that our roles wouldn't have been reversed?~
@1498=~... Perhaps you're right. Still, I'm going to keep a close eye on him. If I sense even for a moment that he's planning to betray us, I'll take action.~
@1499=~Thank you, love. Let's get moving.~
@1500=~He's my brother, and my responsibility, love. If the need arises, I will end his life as I did once before. Let's go.~
@1501=~Thank you, Schael. Let's get moving.~
@1502=~He's my brother, and my responsibility, Major. If the need arises, I will end his life as I did once before. Let's go.~
@1504=~There'll be time to grieve later. This is what the Five likely have in store for the Sword Coast, including Baldur's Gate. We have to stop them.~
@1505=~We will. First Yaga-Shura, then the rest.~
@1506=~Right.~
@1507=~Stand ready — this place has been overrun by giants.~
@1508=~The city's been completely destroyed.~
@1509=~I haven't seen destruction like this since Caelar's crusade.~
@1510=~Unhh...~ [xalc1004]
@1511=~You look a little under the weather, love. Is everything alright?~
@1512=~Yeah... it must've been something I ate. Don't worry, I'll be fine. Let's keep moving.~
@1513=~Shh! I don't want him to ...~
@1514=~(You can't make out the rest of their discussion. It ends, and Schael turns to you.)~
@1515=~Aerie, do you have a minute? I need to talk to you about something, in private.~
@1516=~Jaheira, do you have a minute? I need to talk to you about something, in private.~
@1517=~<CHARNAME> ... there's something I need to tell you. I ...~
@1518=~I'm pregnant.~ [xalc1186]
@1519=~What? But you don't look pregnant — are you sure?~
@1520=~I'm certain. I'm late this month, and a couple of days ago the morning sickness started. It's the same as when I was pregnant with Rohma. I won't start showing for probably six to eight weeks, but I'm definitely with child.~
@1521=~Schael, that's wonderful news!~
@1522=~It is. I'm so happy to be carrying our child. You're going to make a great father.~
@1523=~But... how can that be?~
@1524=~What do you mean, how? We were intimate two or three times a week for over a month. It was bound to happen.~
@1525=~But Schael ... We need to find a way to get you home. We can't risk the safety of our child.~
@1527=~No, I won't leave your side. At least not yet. The timing is terrible of course, but I can still do everything that I need to, on or off the battlefield. Once I start showing, that might change...~
@1528=~But, I did speak to Aerie about this... I think you might've overheard some of our discussion. ~
@1529=~But, I did speak to Jaheira about this... I think you might've overheard some of our discussion.~
@1530=~Before we left Baldur's Gate, I spoke with Helena, one of the Fist's medics, just as a precaution.~
@1532=~I'm going to have this baby. Don't ask me not to. The timing is terrible I know, but I can still do everything that I need to, on or off the battlefield. Once I start showing, that might change ... and I might need to return home.~
@1533=~Schael, you know that I love you. But a baby, now?~
@1534=~It's too dangerous for you to remain here, with me.~
@1536=~Is there anything that I can do for you? I hear pregnant women get some odd cravings from time to time.~
@1537=~Thank you, but I'm fine love. If I need anything, I'll let you know. But ... since you mentioned it, there is one thing ...~
@1538=~I don't want anyone to give me any special treatment, or to even know I'm pregnant. Eventually they'll find out of course, but for now, let's keep it between us.~
@1539=~I don't want anyone to give me any special treatment. Aerie knows, but I don't want the rest to know I'm pregnant. Eventually they'll find out of course, but for now, let's keep it between us.~
@1540=~I don't want anyone to give me any special treatment. Jaheira knows, but I don't want the rest to know I'm pregnant. Eventually they'll find out of course, but for now, let's keep it between us.~
@1541=~As you wish, dear.~
@1542=~Come here, hero.~
@1543=~I love you. More than you know.~
@1544=~And I love you too, Schael.~
@1545=~(You share a warm embrace, followed by a passionate kiss.)~
@1546=~Not even Imoen?~
@1547=~Well, sure. She's your sister after all, and I know she can keep a secret. But no one else, please. Auntie Imoen ... has a nice ring to it, eh? ~
@1548=~It does. She's going to be thrilled when she hears the news.~
@1550=~Did she tell you if it was a boy or a girl?~
@1552=~No, I didn't ask her. It's better not to know, I think.~
@1553=~I don't believe it! <CHARNAME>, this is Neb! He's wanted for the murder of more than two dozen children!~
@1554=~Did she give you a due date?~
@1555=~I'm going to be a father ...~
@1556=~Schael, I ... I'm not sure if I'm ready for this responsibility.~
@1557=~I understand your misgivings, and that this is a lot to process. But you're ready for this. I've seen how you are with Rohma. I know you'd be a great father to our child ... I know it.~
@1558=~But a baby, now? Given all of the danger we face?~
@1559=~Are you sure? That you're pregnant, I mean?~
@1560=~I'm not as sure ... but I promise you, I'm going to give it my all. This is wonderful news!~
@1561=~The fewer people who learn of this, the better.~ [xalc1187]
@1562=~No, but I figure I'm between four and six weeks in. Probably closer to six, which means I'll likely start showing ten to twelve weeks from now. We still have time to do what we need to here.~
@1563=~I'm here for you, my love. If there's anything you require, you need only ask.~
@1564=~Funny you mention that. When I was pregnant with Rohma, one night I had the strongest craving for roasted turnips. Not mashed, diced, or boiled, they *had* to be roasted. The market was closed, so my father had to go to the greengrocer's house in the middle of the night to buy some, then come back and cook them. I guess Jan would have us covered this time around, should that particular craving return. There is one thing that I ask, though ...~
@1565=~Do you know when you're expecting?~
@1566=~She told me that a baby in its mothers womb will remain healthy so long as the mother is. Even if I'm killed in battle, once I'm resurrected, our baby will be as well.~
@1567=~What did she say?~
@1568=~Aerie told me the news. Congratulations, <CHARNAME>. You're going to be a father.~
@1569=~She told you? I thought she wanted to keep it a secret, at least for the time being.~
@1570=~She did. She was bouncing with energy, so naturally I asked her what was going on ... It didn't take long for her to spill the beans.~
@1571=~Thanks, Schael.~
@1572=~The two of you will do great as parents. Care for a bit of advice?~
@1573=~Sir, pardon the interruption, but we discovered the fugitive Neb hiding in the sewers beneath the city. I'm pleased to inform you that he's been brought to justice.~
@1574=~Certainly.~
@1575=~Not right now — we need to get moving. I'll pick your brain over the coming days and weeks, I'm sure.~
@1576=~Sounds good.~
@1578=~Hah, I'm not surprised.~
@1579=~Somehow, I don't think she'd last long in a Flaming Fist interrogation.~
@1580=~Sir?~
@1581=~The first few months with a newborn are always rough. It's easier to take care of your baby and to be a loving parent when you are in a good place, mentally, physically and emotionally. You and Aerie will need to work together to share the load.~
@1582=~So, we need to practice good self-care, in other words.~
@1583=~Right. Also, you'll need to spend a lot of time cuddling and holding your baby. It helps a lot to read to your baby, too. Cuddling will make them feel loved and secure, and reading to them will help them to understand language.~
@1584=~That makes sense ... any additional advice?~
@1585=~When your child is Rohma's age, the most important thing you can do for them is to make sure that they feel safe, loved and valued. In that order, preferably. Your child will struggle without a safe and stable environment, and their sense of self-worth will suffer if you don't show them the unconditional love that only a parent can.~
@1586=~That is great advice. You've given me a lot to think about... thank you, my friend.~
@1587=~Anytime. If you or Aerie have any questions, please, just ask.~
@1588=~Parenting Advice
Major Corwin offered me some valuable parenting advice, which I gladly accepted.~
@1589=~Two letters. One to the Dukes, and one to my father. I need to let my family know that we're fine.~
@1590=~I need an additional letter delivered ... My family needs to know that we're fine.~
@1592=~Of course.~
@1593=~What do you suggest we do?~
@1594=~This town might have a message courier we can use. Let's have a look around.~ [xalc1249]
@1595=~Listen — we need to provide an update to the Dukes. They'll want to know that the fire giants have been dealt with, and they'll need my report on what we've learned concerning the Five. They also need to know about what transpired in the oasis... hopefully, things can be smoothed over with the Tethyrian royals. I also need to let my family know that we're fine...~
@1596=~Listen — we need to provide an update to the Dukes. They'll want to know that the fire giants have been dealt with, and they'll need my report on what we've learned concerning the Five. They also need to know about what transpired in the oasis... hopefully, things can be smoothed over with the Tethyrian royals. I also need to let my family know that we're fine... and that I'm with child.~
@1597=~Of course, love.~
@1598=~How do you think your father will take the news? And Rohma?~
@1599=~Rohma will be thrilled, and I know she'll be a wonderful big sister to our baby. As for my father ... he'll be happy to have another grandchild, certainly, but he's going to have some stern words for me when I get back.~
@1600=~What do you suggest we do, love?~
@1603=~To be honest, I've never given much thought as to what people would say about us, and what we've accomplished. What's certain is that <CHARNAME> is the only hero here, Volo. I doubt people would be interested in my story.~
@1604=~To be honest, I've never given much thought as to what people would say about us, and what we've accomplished. Or, for that matter, the love we share. What's certain is that <CHARNAME> is the only hero here, Volo. I doubt people would be interested in my story.~
@1605=~Love must dare to risk. Otherwise, it isn't love at all.~
@1606=~R-Rohma!? How — come here! Honey, that man is dangerous!~
@1607=~Mommy, why didn't you come home? Why weren't you there to protect us?~
@1608=~What ... what do you mean? What happened!?~
@1609=~They came... they killed grandpa and then they killed me, mommy... You killed me!~
@1610=~Um... yes sir. Sorry, sir.~
@1611=~Schael, calm yourself! Rohma is safe with your father at the Ducal palace. Whatever this thing is, it isn't your daughter.~
@1612=~You wanted us to die, so that you could start a new family with <CHARNAME>! You never loved me!~
@1613=~N-no, Rohma! I love you more than anything! Oh, gods, no...~
@1614=~Enough! I won't allow this to continue!~
@1615=~Whatever you are, enough! She doesn't deserve this!~
@1616=~We don't have time for games. Let's go.~
@1617=~I'm sorry, my love... I was just trying to lighten the grim mood.~
@1618=~Jealous? At least she doesn't come with a kid.~
@1619=~Unbelievable, <CHARNAME>! If you really can't keep it in your pants during a time like this, then fine! Enjoy your whore — we're through.~
@1620=~You know that I love your playfulness and sense of humor, but this really isn't the time. Let's give the girl a bit of money so that she doesn't need to work the streets, then get on with our mission.~
@1621=~(She reaches up and touches the scar left behind from Bodhi's bite.)~
@1622=~Thank you, sir.~
@1623=~Are you alright?~
@1624=~I don't approve of this, but I think there's more to this woman than meets the eye. Go with her, and watch your back.~
@1625=~You know I don't approve of this... but there's something about her. She may have some important information that she'll only disclose in private. Go with her, but watch your back.~
@1626=~Illasera's dead. <CHARNAME> and I saw to that after she kidnapped my daughter.~
@1627=~Something's not right here.~ [xalc1054]
@1628=~She is... and neither I, nor the Dukes, nor the Flaming Fist will allow the Five to threaten Baldur's Gate or its citizens again.~
@1629=~We better let Marshal Nederlok know what happened here. He'll be in his office back at headquarters. Let's go, love.~
@1630=~We better let Marshal Nederlok know what happened here. He'll be in his office back at headquarters. Let's go.~
@1631=~I won't be party to this madness any longer. If you ever clean up your act, you can find me in the Athkatla magistrate.~ [xalc1322]
@1632=~She's right. If we can find a way to turn him, he may prove a valuable ally.~
@1633=~<CHARNAME> — we may be able to use this situation to our advantage. If we can turn Solaufein instead of killing him, he could prove a valuable ally.~
@1634=~Nice trick. You must be Jarlaxle.~
@1635=~Soon, Captain.~
@1636=~Soon, love.~
@1637=~Lead the way.~
@1638=~You've been saying that for the last four hours. Either come with me now, or I'll see you tomorrow during the debriefing.~
@1639=~See you tomorrow, then.~
@1640=~Mmm...~
@1641=~How are you feeling, love?~
@1642=~What is it, dear?~
@1643=~I'm fine, hon. I was just remembering something... in the caravan, on our way to Saradush, you said you were having nightmares. Something... about having to make a very difficult decision...~
@1644=~What would that mean for us? For our child? There's nothing I can offer you that can compare with that.~
@1645=~I didn't understand what you meant at the time, but I think that I'm beginning to...~
@1646=~Yes... I've been thinking about that as well.~
@1647=~Where are you going with this?~
@1648=~Hungry? I'm sure we can find something our packs to satisfy any new cravings.~
@1649=~I see a change in you, love. Your skill in battle is unlike anything I've ever seen. You're becoming something... greater, if that makes sense.~
@1650=~You know that I've never placed much value on prophecies. But, if you did have to choose between godhood, and this life...?~ [xalc1248]
@1651=~Your love is enough, Schael. It's more than any <PRO_MANWOMAN> can ask for.~
@1652=~But don't you see, that's exactly it! A <PRO_MANWOMAN> is mortal, and a god is not. What are mortal concerns like love, children, and companionship, to an immortal being?~
@1653=~If I did become a god, I'd still love you. I'd be able to do things for you, and our child, that I could never do as a <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@1655=~I - I'm sorry. Forget I said anything. I know you have enough on your mind already, and me worrying about these things isn't good for our baby.~
@1656=~I imagine you'd be able to do anything. Except be with me, that is. Besides, what are mortal concerns like love, children, and companionship, to an immortal being?~
@1658=~And how is our baby?~
@1659=~(She smiles.)~
@1660=~Good, love. I just can't wait to get home. Come on, let's go.~
@1661=~My love, a moment of your time?~
@1662=~Of course, what's on your mind?~
@1663=~We'd discussed a couple of months ago that I'd need to go home once I started showing.~
@1664=~I don't want to leave your side, but I need to do what's best for our child. Besides, I won't be nearly as effective in the field and if one of your enemies sees that I'm pregnant, they'll find a way to use that against you.~
@1665=~Right... how long do you think it will be, before you're visibly pregnant?~
@1666=~I'd guess around four weeks. Maybe less. Hopefully we can wrap up what we need to here, then head back home. Let's go.~
@1667=~<CHARNAME>... It's time. I need to go home. Have the gateway send me back to Baldur's Gate.~
@1668=~Before I go, come here...~
@1669=~(She takes your hand and places it on her belly, underneath her armor and vestment.)~
@1670=~Wait for it...~
@1672=~I felt it! I felt our baby kick!~
@1673=~Mm. That's your child, love. It's going to need its father to come home. And so will I.~
@1674=~(She struggles to hold back tears.)~
@1675=~Please, love... promise me... promise me you'll come home...~
@1676=~Can't you stay with me for a while longer? I need you.~
@1677=~I want to, more than anything. But I can't. Look, love.~
@1678=~(She moves her hand around her belly... it's clear that she'll no longer able to hide that she's pregnant.)~
@1679=~I... I understand, love.~
@1680=~I will. I promise.~
@1681=~I'll do everything in my power to return to you, Schael.~
@1682=~(You share a tender and very emotional embrace.)~
@1683=~I'll be waiting, love... Be *sob* careful, alright?~
@1684=~Here, take my pack. I won't need it anymore...~
@1685=~I'm ready, love. Send me home.~
@1686=~As you wish, dear...~
@1687=~Oh Schael *sob*, I — I'll miss you!~
@1688=~I'll miss you too, Aerie. Please look after <CHARNAME> for me while I'm gone.~
@1689=~It's been an honor to fight at your side, Major.~
@1690=~The honor is mine. Thank you, Keldorn.~
@1691=~Aye girlie, don't ye worry yer sweet little behind. Ole Korgan'll make sure yer <PRO_MANWOMAN> comes home in one piece.~
@1692=~I appreciate that. Thank you, Korgan.~
@1693=~Schael! I'll miss you! Please, give Liia my regards.~
@1694=~I will Imoen... and I'll miss you too. Take good care of your <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> for me.~
@1695=~Good luck with the babies! (Hee-hee)~
@1696=~Sorry, what was that?~
@1697=~I said, good luck with the baby!~
@1698=~Thank you, Neera. I appreciate it.~
@1699=~Take care of yourself, Major. Give your father my regards.~
@1700=~You too, Valygar.~
@1701=~Schael — I shall miss you, my friend.~
@1702=~I'll miss you too Rasaad. Take care of yourself.~
@1703=~Though it must hurt to leave <PRO_HIMHER>, in time you'll realize that you've made the right decision, Schael. The battlefield is no place for an expecting mother.~
@1704=~Right... thank you Jaheira.~
@1705=~I'll miss our little discussions on the plight of the poor, and how best to tackle the inequality that plagues our cities.~
@1706=~I... won't. But I'll miss you, Nalia.~
@1707=~Schael, I'm fortunate to have been able to fight alongside you these past months. You will be missed, by all of us.~
@1708=~And I'm fortunate to be able to call you a friend, Mazzy. Be well.~
@1709=~Major soldier lady, Boo wishes you well, and asks if you would be so kind as to kiss him.~
@1710=~No. I'm not kissing anyone's rode—, excuse me, 'space-hamster'.~
@1711=~In that case, can Boo give you a kiss? Just a peck on the cheek?~
@1712=~(Sigh.)~
@1713=~Sure, Minsc.~
@1714=~(She leans in, and Boo head-bumps her on her cheek.)~
@1715=~Ugh...~
@1716=~(She turns to your comrades.)~
@1717=~Alas, it is time for my raven to take flight and return to her nest.~
@1718=~Goodbye, Haer'Dalis.~
@1719=~Don't worry, I'll keep <PRO_HIMHER> out of trouble.~
@1720=~That's very kind of you. Thank you.~
@1721=~This reminds me of the time when —~
@1722=~Jan. I'll miss you, too.~
@1723=~Aye. Before you go Schael, take this recipe. It's for a buttered turnip puree. My children loved it when they were wee babies.~
@1728=~...~
@1729=~I, um... I don't know anything about that.~
@1751=~(She gives you a kiss on the cheek.)~
@1752=~Let's go.~ [xalc1188]
@1754=~I thought I'd *sob* lost you...~
@1755=~(She lays her head down on your chest, and you hold her tenderly in your arms. In moments, she finally loses her composure and begins to weep in earnest.)~
@1756=~Good. Let's deal with Chremy, then get those two kids out of here.~
@1757=~(You gently caress her head as you feel her warm tears touch your skin.)~
@1758=~(She plants a kiss on your forehead.)~
@1760=~(You slide over so there is enough room on the bed for the two of you. When she climbs in, you kiss and rest in each other's embrace.)~
@1761=~She won't be joining us. I'll not allow the monster to feed on the citizens I'm sworn to protect.~
@1762=~Are you and Rasaad settled in?~
@1763=~Engagement Ring
I proposed to Schael, and she accepted! We're to be married!~
@1764=~Come on! Let's go get Rasaad and celebrate!~

@1796=~Long Arm of the Law
Marshal Nederlok of the Baldur's Gate Flaming Fist was pleased to hear of Neb's demise in the sewers beneath the city.~
@1797=~I see. After you, my dear.~
@1798=~I see. After you, Captain.~
@1799=~Peace, General. I'm Major Schael Corwin of the Baldur's Gate Flaming Fist, assisting <CHARNAME> on a special assignment. The Grand Dukes have ordered —~
@1800=~The Flaming Fist and the Grand Dukes, in league with a Bhaalspawn? Did I hear you correctly?~
@1801=~Yes sir. We are hunting the members of an organization known as The Five. I can assure you that <CHARNAME> is innocent of the crimes you describe.~
@1802=~My orders are clear. <CHARNAME>, and any who travel with <PRO_HIMHER>, are to be executed on sight. May the gods have mercy on your soul.~
@1803=~I hoped to talk you out of this madness, but I see words alone won't get this job done. All right then. Let's go.~ [xalc1154]
@1804=~This is bad. We better get out of here before the Tethyrian reinforcements arrive. Let's go.~

// v1.04 Additions 11/05/2023
@1805=~Come on. We need to get that amulet.~
@1806=~Right. Let's go.~
@1807=~Are you sure you're okay with this?~
@1808=~Captain Corwin endorsing larceny? I'd not have thought it possible.~
@1809=~I'm not comfortable with it, but we need to find your sister and Irenicus. Unless you have other ideas, this looks to be the only path forward.~ [xalc1203]
@1810=~Agreed. Let's go.~
@1811=~We might be asked to do things far worse than simple theft. Will I be able to count on you?~
@1812=~Come on. We need to get that statue.~
@1813=~If it helps to advance our mission, then yes. I have my limits though, and I won't stand for gratuitous crime. I trust I've made myself clear? Good. Now let's go.~ [xalc1204]
@1814=~Breaking the Law
Captain Corwin assured me that she's willing to do what is needed to accomplish her mission, including running afoul of local laws. She has her limits though, and she warned me not to test them.~
@1815=~I'm on a special assignment from the Grand Dukes, and it doesn't involve shutting down whatever operation you and your boss have set up here. That's all you need to know.~ [xalc1205]
@1816=~Let me have a look at that.~
@1817=~Of course. It's yours, if you have the coin.~
@1818=~As I suspected. These artifacts were reported stolen years ago. How did you acquire these?~ [xalc1207]
@1819=~I can assure you that I only procure from the most reputable vendors.~
@1820=~Some of these items once belonged to Balduran, the founder of Baldur's Gate. They were stolen years ago from the Hall of Wonders. I'm sure the Council and the city historians would greatly appreciate it if we could bring them back to the Gate.~ [xalc1199]
@1821=~I'm sure they would, but they must cost a fortune!~
@1822=~I'm aware. If we could bring even one of these items back though...~ [xalc1245]
@1823=~It's clear that this is important to you. Let's do what we can.~
@1824=~Agreed. Let's bring these historical artifacts home, where they belong.~
@1825=~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1826=~Returning the Stolen Artifacts
Captain Corwin has identified some stolen merchandise that once belonged to Balduran, the famed founder of Baldur's Gate. They were stolen from the Hall of Wonders many years ago during a brazen heist. Though expensive, the Dukes and city historians would likely reward me quite handsomely for their return.~
@1827=~Sure you do. And I'm the queen of Tethyr.~
@1828=~Captain? Is there a problem?~
@1829=~Schael? Is there a problem?~
@1830=~*Ahem* Is there a problem, your highness?~
@1831=~No. There are better ways to spend the money. Some other time, perhaps.~
@1832=~Thank you, love.~
@1833=~Rohma, look what <CHARNAME> brought for you!~
@1834=~She's lied to me before, but this time I think she's telling the truth. I'd like for us to help her, but it's your decision.~ [xalc1001]
@1835=~Very well. Tianna - tell me, where is this Jasper fellow? Perhaps I can talk him into forgiving your debt.~
@1836=~I'm afraid it's not my problem.~
@1837=~I'd stay and celebrate, but I can't stomach being at the side of a lich any longer. Farewell.~
@1838=~I can't bear to fight at your side any longer. Listen, lich — set foot in Baldur's Gate again and I'll crush your bones to dust. Goodbye.~
@1839=~Heh... the joys of parenthood.~
@1840=~Think they learned their lesson?~
@1841=~They seem like good kids. I'm sure from now on they'll be on their best behavior.~ [xalc1246]
@1842=~If you say so.~
@1843=~Boys will be boys, I suppose.~
@1844=~I'm just glad things turned out as well as they did. It could have been a lot worse. I'll have the Fist wizards properly ward the tower so that something like this doesn't happen again.~ [xalc1247]
@1845=~Let's go, love.~
@1846=~Let's go.~
@1847=~Cute kid. She can't be more than a couple of years older than Rohma.~ [xalc1317]
@1848=~I was thinking the same thing.~
@1849=~Mereth? She's certainly in more trouble than Rohma.~
@1850=~That's for sure. It's terrible what the Thayans have done to these people.~
@1851=~Rohma... gods, I miss her. My father, too. I can't wait for all of this to be over.~
@1852=~You and me both. Come on, let's get going.~
@1853=~Right.~ [xad10043]
@1854=~(She points to the sky. Looking up, you see a large, reddish-brown dragon. As it flies between some low-hanging clouds and into the light, it casts an ominous shadow over the battlefield. It seems to be circling above the area just west of the central keep.)~
@1855=~On second thought, you're right. I'll walk you home.~
@1856=~No more than the ordinary teenager, I'm sure.~
@1857=~You're friends ditched you?~
@1858=~You flatter me. I feel like anyone in my position would've taken the same actions.~
@1859=~Somehow, I know that you're right. Thank you, Schael.~
@1860=~I feel the same way... Stay safe, love.~
@1861=~I feel great. Wonderful, even.~ 
@1862=~You and I both.~
@1863=~It was incredible, wasn't it?~
@1864=~Hahahah. Wait. You're kidding, right? The hero of Baldur's Gate, champion of the Sword Coast a... a virgin? You mean no one, ever?~
@1865=~Not anymore, thanks to you.~
@1866=~But — you mean no one? Ever?~
@1867=~Is it really so hard to believe? Growing up in Candlekeep, there were hardly any women my age, and even less privacy. Then, after Sarevok, I couldn't step out of the palace without being mobbed by the citizens. I never had an opportunity to develop a relationship with someone special... someone like you.~
@1868=~I was pleasantly surprised to see that you're as talented in the bedroom as you are on the battlefield. You must've had many lovers, mm?~ 
@1869=~Not too many... certainly no one as amazing as you, Schael.~
@1870=~Wow.. I mean.. thank you. I appreciate that. I'm honored to have been your first.~
@1871=~Heh, you're right. I was only joking... though none of my prior lovers could compare to you, dear.~
@1872=~<CHARNAME>. How are you?~
@1873=~I'm fine, Schael. And you? How is the day treating you?~
@1874=~Better, now that I'm talking to you. How are you?~
@1875=~You know... I haven't stopped thinking about how you made love to me.~
@1876=~Many lovers? Schael... you were my first.~
@1877=~I've always considered sex as a purely physical endeavor, never an emotional one. It's certainly something that I enjoy more than most. But with you...~
@1878=~With you, <CHARNAME>, I feel a much deeper connection. It was more than sex... it was love, in it's most pure, intense and, heh, messy form. I hope you understand that.~
@1879=~There's no need to be modest, hero. I've had my share of lovers as well... and not just men, mind you. My last real relationship, with Tianna... well, you know how that turned out.~
@1880=~Flatterer. I've had my share of lovers as well... and not just men, mind you. My last real relationship, with Tianna... well, you know how that turned out.~
@1881=~I'm fine, Schael. And you? How is the evening treating you?~
@1882=~Oh, don't mind me. Look at you, with that smile! You should do it more often.~
@1883=~You'll find I'm full of surprises.~
@1884=~I just can't believe that someone with so little experience could... I mean... for that long, and to make me... gods! Four times!~
@1885=~The Candlekeep library has books on nearly every subject you can imagine, including one on the secrets to extraordinary lovemaking. I probably read that one a half-dozen times.~
@1886=~Hah! You'll need to show me everything that you've learned!~
@1887=~I think it was more than four, my dear.~
@1888=~You know, you might be right. In any case, I've never experienced anything like it.~
@1889=~I do understand, and I want you to know that I feel the same way.~
@1890=~I see things the same way. What we have is more than simple physical attraction. It's love. And I couldn't be happier about it.~
@1891=~I can't tell you how refreshing it is to hear that. All of my prior relationships ended because there wasn't that kind of deeper connection that you're describing.~
@1892=~I don't have the same experience you do when it comes to relationships. All I know is that what I feel for you is real.~
@1893=~That's good. Come here.~
@1894=~(You kiss and embrace.)~
@1895=~We better get a move on. Let's go, love.~
@1896=~Is it really so hard to believe? Growing up in Candlekeep, there were hardly any men my age, and even less privacy. Then, after Sarevok, I couldn't step out of the palace without being mobbed by the citizens. I never had an opportunity to develop a relationship with someone special... someone like you.~
