@1   = ~Hail and welcome. The bar and kitchen are at your disposal, but if you imbibe a bit too much, do mind the furniture. We replaced everything just last week after an unfortunate meeting between a patron's head and most of the fixtures. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@2   = ~Yes.~
@3   = ~No.~
@4   = ~Hmm? Hello. Mind you don't get stains in the rooms, as we don't clean them too terribly often. Not that you would be likely to... I mean... what I meant to say was... Ah, to the planes with it! Just try not to make trouble while here. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@5   = ~I expect you have the gold to be bothering me? Fine, stay as you will. Rest assured however, that if I find a single piece of cutlery missing I'll have you quartered while you sleep. This ain't no ultimate place to be stealing forks and spoons you know. Is there anything I can do for you?~
