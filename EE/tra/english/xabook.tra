@0=~If you're able to provide the volumes I require, I'll give you an item from my personal collection... a Book of Many Spells.~
@1=~Thank you for your assistance in completing my collection.~
@2=~Though the individual tomes aren't rare, collecting the entire set has proven more difficult than I imagined.~
@3=~Ah, very good. Thank you. Please, continue your search for the other volumes.~
@4=~A friend of mine informed me that several volumes from the set were sold to collectors in the city, though he could not share anything further. Through scrying, my familiar was able to determine that the tomes are scattered through the city, with at least one volume in each district. I do not know their precise locations.~
@5=~Would I be rewarded for this work?~
@6=~The last volume of the set! Marvelous! Here is the book I promised you. May it serve you well.~
@7=~Time now to return to my library. Farewell.~
@8=~My name is Hebert, and I am a collector of rare and exotic books.~
