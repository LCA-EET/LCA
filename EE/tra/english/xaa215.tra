@1=~Surely there are more interesting places for you to be. This is but a simple common home.~
@2=~All the homes in Baldur's Gate are well protected. Please behave accordingly.~
@3=~Help! I am violated in my own home!~
@4=~I wish I was up to making a fine supper for the lot of you, but I've only enough for my family. Perhaps you'd stay and enjoy the comforts of my humble home? It seems to me though, that you're not the type to have time for rest. I wish you the best.~
@5=~I'll not speak a word after what you did!~
