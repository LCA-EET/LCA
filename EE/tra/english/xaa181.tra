@1=~Hi, folks, welcome to Lucky Aello's, where the prices are so low there's gotta be something wrong. Nobody sells it lower than me, because nobody buys it cheaper. If you can find a price lower than mine this side of Calimshan, the item will probably kill you. What can I get for you?~
@2=~So you've got the cheapest goods around? Let's have a look.~
@3=~No, thanks. You get what you pay for.~
