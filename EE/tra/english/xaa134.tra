@1=~Those Iron Throne fellows are quite the secretive bunch. Sarevok, the foster son of their leader, is quite the charmer, though.~
@2=~Investigating the Iron Throne
Sarevok, son of one of the Iron Throne's leaders, has become increasingly popular in Baldur's Gate.~
@3=~I heard that Sarevok might be willing to donate a large portion of his coster's iron supplies to the city.~
@4=~I'll definitely vote for Sarevok in the coming election. He might be new, but he has a lot to add to the city.~
@5=~I do hope they catch those rapscallions that escaped from Candlekeep. From what I understand they were trying to frame the Iron Throne for what's really the fault of Amn. To think that Duke Eltan was trusting Amnian spies.~
@6=~I have a vested interest in the Seven Suns trading coster. It upsets me to no end how much they've lost to bandits over the past few weeks.~
@7=~As a man of distinguished lineage, I rarely stoop to the common events of the peasant. I doubt that there is anything I could tell you that you would find useful. Sorry friend.~
@8=~Approach me not! I'll ruffle you up, I will!~
