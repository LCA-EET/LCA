@0 = ~A Strange Dagger
The djinn that I freed from my captor's stronghold gave me this strange dagger, which he described as a prison of souls. Could this be the dagger that was used to murder Skie Silvershield? If so, I need to find a way to get it back to the city as soon as possible â€” Skie may yet be saved, and moreover, she can confirm my innocence!~
