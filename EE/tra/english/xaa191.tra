@1=~You there. This is MY kitchen, and I don't like interlopers, so get out!~
@2=~Didn't I tell you to get out? I don't want you in my kitchen, can't you get that through yer thick skull?~
@3=~It's you again. By the claws of Umberlee, I can't take these interruptions much longer. Get out of my kitchen, and stay out.~
@4=~I'm just a cook, what should I know?~
@5=~Out! And never darken my door again!~
