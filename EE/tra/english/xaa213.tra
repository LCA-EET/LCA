@1=~I've no wish to seem unwelcoming, but I dislike armed people entering my home uninvited. Please exit the way you came in.~
@2=~I've no desire to call the guards, but I will if I must.~
@3=~Perhaps I would not mind your company quite so much if I had actually invited you. Please leave my home.~
@4=~I don't leave my home much, so there's little I know about what goes on within the city. Why don't you take this gold piece and enjoy yourself at the market square? There's all sorts of things to do there.~
@5=~Leave me! You've outstayed your welcome!~
