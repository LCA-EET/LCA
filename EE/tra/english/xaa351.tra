@1=~Aye, share a glass with Gorpel Hind and his Band of Merry Fools.~
@2=~We must go. For all its light, your friendship has brought darkness upon us. Gorpel Hind, our leader and soulmate, has fallen in this petty battle.~
@3=~A brave and hearty fight and it was good to share it with you. We must go, however, and tend to our wounds elsewhere. I do not think the bartender will tolerate our type of merriment for long. Well met, brave <CHARNAME>, and do not walk softly into that dark night.~
