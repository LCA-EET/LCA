@0=~Oh, dear! I trust your daughter is alright?~
@1=~I'm glad to hear that your child is fine... but I've not heard of the Five before.~
@2=~That's odd. I'd have thought that someone with as much knowledge on the matter would be familiar with them. In any case, with Illasera gone, what other Bhaalspawn should I be concerned with?~
@3=~One of them was named Illasera. It was she who hounded my protected Bhaalspawn earlier and forced us to flee to Saradush, but she left weeks ago for the Sword Coast.~
