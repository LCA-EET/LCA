@1   = ~You shouldn't have broken into my master's home. Master Jardak will be quite displeased when he learns that ruffians have disturbed the order of his house.~
@2   = ~Who the hell are you, and why are you dressed in such silly colors?~
@3   = ~Tell your master Jardak that we want to talk to him right away.~
@4   = ~We'll be leaving now. Sorry if we made a mess, but I'm sure you won't be that hard up to just clean up after us.~
@5   = ~My name is Drelik. But really, my name or the clothes I choose to wear are of no consequence. Of consequence here is that you have broken into my master's house and made a mess. I think I'll have to clean up the mess... permanently.~
@6   = ~Jardak will not see anyone, especially not a bunch of hooligans. Well, lest I seem rude, I had better introduce myself. My name is Drelik. Now that you know my name, I can go about the task of cleaning up the mess you've made, which incidentally includes removing you from the premises.~
@7   = ~Oh, no! You won't be leaving now... not after the mess you've made. My master has given specific instructions that anyone who breaks into his dwelling is not to go anywhere... ever again.~
