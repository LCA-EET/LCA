@1=~I'm not fat, I'm big-boned! Enormously boned, actually. Fantastically huge bones the likes of which have never before been seen on creatures without a trunk or a blowhole.~
@2=~I wish I could help you friend, but I've not been able to collect my thoughts since I missed breakfast this morning. Practically wasting away, I am.~
@3=~Away with you, or the guard will have you boiled in oil! Or perhaps... fricasseed in oil... with a lovely salmon, white wine sauce and those little bread sticks that are just sooo good. Yum.~
@4=~There's a thin person inside me just screaming to get out. Serves him right, though. Shouldn't have stood so close to the buffet.~
@5=~Oh, this iron shortage is TERRIBLE! If it weren't for SILVERware I don't know how I'd survive.~
