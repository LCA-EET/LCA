@1=~Frightfully sorry, but this room is off limits for the time being. No offense intended, you understand. It's just that we've a rather nervous guest who insists that their room be kept under strictest lock and key. Frightfully sorry, but you cannot pass.~
@2=~I am afraid I shall have to ask you to step back. Please do so, as I can only give so many warnings before I must enforce my request. I must also remind you that the city guard always sides with house security in matters such as this, so any disturbance here will surely bring them out to assist.~
@3=~You have all of a few seconds to step back! I cannot allow entry, and if you persist, I shall be forced to apply my blade! Please do not force the issue!~
@4=~I have little alternative! Defend yourself!~
@5=~You have one chance to leave this instant. Hesitate and you lose your head.~
@6=~Enter as you please, good friend! I trust that you'll be no trouble.~
@7=~You're not welcome here! Get out or be thrown out!~
