@0=~Distractions, distractions. Even in these filthy sewers, a gnome can't find peace, hee hee...~
@1=~You look familiar... yes... Captain Corwin, is it? You had me arrested just before I could introduce myself to your sweet, precious little daughter.~
@2=~I don't know how you found me, but I promise that when I'm done with you, I'll be sure to pay her a visit!~
@3=~Have you reason to be here? I do not recall summoning such as you. Do I... know you? I do not think it is so.~
@4=~You seem familiar... who are you?~
@5=~Oh... hee hee! Oh, you shall be very sorry, indeed! You have found me out, and now you must pay, oh yes. A little old for my taste, but no matter!~
@6=~You have no cause to know my name unless you were sent by the law! Do vengeful families cry out for my capture?~
@7=~Come then, attack! And your deaths shall be a riddle for some other fool to solve!~
@9=~I'll be going then. Sorry to have bothered you.~
