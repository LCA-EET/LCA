// BG1
@1000 = ~Processing BG1 changes...~
@1001 = ~Welcome all to the Hall of Wonders. A mere gold piece secures entry to the most curious collection priceless historical artifacts and machination inspirations on all Abeir-Toril. The craft displayed within is truly a sight to see, and the gold raised goes to needed supplies, that future wonders will be wrought.~
@1002 = ~Good on you, friend. Come inside the Hall of Wonders, but please remember the 1 gold donation. It provides sponsorship for those that craft the curious wonders inspired by Gond, and for those that maintain and protect the priceless artifacts contained herein. This patronage supports the... not immediately salable works produced.~
@1003 = ~I should be safe here. In the mean time, you have quite the task ahead of you. If I'm right, the Iron Throne is going to stage a coup. I fear that Nederlok, Corwin and the others won't return in time.  You're the only ones who'll be able to stop the coup.~ 
@1004 = ~I am again in your debt. That creature has kept me helpless for too long. Perhaps if I hadn't been incapacitated, I might have been able to prevent Scar's death. *cough* Angelo will soon hear of my recovery. It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the Harbor Master's building — he is a good friend of mine. I can rest there, and send word to Nederlok and Corwin to return to the city immediately. They're loyalty is beyond reproach, and they can retake control of the Fist while I recover. Take this letter; I managed to filch it off Rashad when he was "caring" for me. From what I read of it, it seems that Sarevok has dire plans for the city. I fear for the lives of my fellow Dukes, Liia and Belt. If they were to die, Sarevok would take over the city. You must find Slythe and Krystin, and stop them... *cough* Hurry! We must make haste.~ 
@1005 = ~Oh yeah, lots of stuff. You know about Duke Eltan, don't ya? He's been diseased. That's why Angelo's in charge now. It'd have been Scar, but he went out and got assassinated, and that Corwin bitch who arrested me's on some training exercise up north with Marshal Nederlok. Ya, the city's gone downhill over the last week. Too bad, heh heh.~
@1006 = ~They still have leadership. How effective it is, I do not know. With Captain Corwin sent on some training exercise up north, I hear Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control. Such a weasel he is. I am surprised he has the support of the troops. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. You've heard of him, right? With Entar dead, the other Dukes have called an emergency election. Sarevok is the front-runner, and his stand against Amn is very popular. Imagine how much pull he will have if he actually has the Flaming Fist in his back pocket.~
@1007 = ~There's trouble in the Fist, <CHARNAME>, big trouble. Duke Eltan's fallen sick and Scar was killed, supposedly in a simple robbery but I have my doubts... It's all Angelo, he's making a power grab, taking control of the Fist and, with Scar gone and Corwin sent on some bogus errand up north, there's nothing to stop him! I've seen him paying visits to the Iron Throne, too, and I don't like it one bit... There are some of us that are still loyal to Eltan and, lucky for you, I happen to be one of them. Please, for your sake and ours, keep your head down and, if you get the chance, sniff around the Iron Throne's base. If you can find a way to talk to Duke Eltan, even better, but they're keeping him in the middle of Fist headquarters... Damn it, Angelo will pay dearly for this and I hope it's soon...~
@1008 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You efforts have not been in vain. My commanding officer, Captain Corwin, has ordered my contingent and I back to the city to make our reports. You will figure prominently in them and I assure you that our accounts will be favorable.~

It's clear that "S.C", whoever they are, has spent a great many hours intently studying the manual; it is well-worn, and several of the pages are coming loose from the binding.~ 
@1013 = ~Burned Document~  
@1014 = ~This document has been burned, but parts of it are still legible. From what you can make out, the recipient was ordered to head to a staging area north of the city, due to a spate of assassinations. They were to wait there and prepare to retake... something.

You now have the time you need to find some way to prove your innocence. If you're able to recover the Soultaker dagger, you must send it to me. The wizards believe they can restore Skie, but only if the dagger is in their possession. Once restored, she can corroborate your account of what happened on that night in Dragonspear. With your innocence established, love, we'll be together once again.    

I've enclosed my amulet with this letter. Wear it and know that I love you, always.

My love,

I pray this letter finds you, Rohma and your father well. There is much that I need to tell you. After being forced to depart Baldur’s Gate, our party was set upon by thieves who quickly incapacitated us. We were delivered to Athkatla and held captive in the stronghold of a mad wizard named Irenicus – the very same “Hooded Man” that we encountered during the Dragonspear campaign. My recollection of events from that point is hazy… I do know that we were tortured and experimented upon for purposes that are unclear to me. We were not all fortunate to escape the wizard’s enclave with our lives. The bastard murdered Khalid and Dynaheir. By the time we found their corpses, nothing could be done to resurrect them.

While fleeing the stronghold, I came upon the dagger that is enclosed with this letter. I believe that this is the very same Soultaker Dagger that was used to murder Skie; if I am correct, the city priests can use it to restore Skie’s soul to her body and perform the resurrection. Please take the dagger to the city priests as soon as you are able. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder. 

After our escape, Imoen and Irenicus were abducted by the Cowled Wizards for unsanctioned use of magical power within the city. They were taken to a prison for magic practitioners called Spellhold. I must venture forth to Spellhold, rescue Imoen, and exact my revenge on Irenicus. The mage will pay for what he did to Khalid and Dynaheir, for framing me for Skie’s murder, for my exile from the city, and for keeping us apart. I will see you again, my love, once my innocence is established and this matter with Irenicus is resolved.

Yours always,

After our escape, Imoen and Irenicus were abducted by the Cowled Wizards for unsanctioned use of magical power within the city. They were taken to a prison for magic practitioners called Spellhold. I must venture forth to Spellhold, rescue Imoen, and exact my revenge on Irenicus. The mage will pay for what he did to Khalid and Dynaheir, for framing me for Skie’s murder, for my exile from the city, and for keeping us apart. I will see you again, my love, once my innocence is established and this matter with Irenicus is resolved.

Yours always,

@3146 = ~This is the letter you plan to send to Captain Corwin in Baldur's Gate. You will need to speak to the Athkatla magistrate in order to have it delivered.

Schael,

I hope this letter finds you, Rohma and your father well. There is much that I need to tell you. After being forced to depart Baldur’s Gate, our party was set upon by thieves who quickly incapacitated us. We were delivered to Athkatla and held captive in the stronghold of a mad wizard named Irenicus – the very same “Hooded Man” that we encountered during the Dragonspear campaign. My recollection of events from that point is hazy… I do know that we were tortured and experimented upon for purposes that are unclear to me. We were not all fortunate to escape the wizard’s enclave with our lives. The bastard murdered Khalid and Dynaheir. By the time we found their corpses, nothing could be done to resurrect them.

While fleeing the stronghold, I came upon the Soultaker dagger. To put a long story short, I released Skie's soul, and I believe that the city priests can restore it to her body and perform the resurrection. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder.

@3147 = ~This is the letter you plan to send to Corporal Duncan in Baldur's Gate. You will need to speak to the Athkatla magistrate in order to have it delivered.

Corporal,

I'm writing to inform you that I recovered the Soultaker dagger, and that I have performed the necessary steps to release Skie's soul. I believe that the city priests can restore it to her body and perform the resurrection. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder. The dagger belonged to a mad wizard named Irenicus. He is the “Hooded Man” that murdered Skie and framed me for the act. Rest assured, he will pay a heavy price for his transgressions against Skie, the city of Baldur’s Gate, my companions, and myself.
  
Please give my regards to Captain Corwin and her father. 

Regards,

<CHARNAME>~

One day, a playful goblin who was passing through overheard the townsfolk speak of just how greedy this husband and wife were. Wanting to learn if the rumors of their greed were true, the goblin decided to pay them a visit. 

The goblin appeared to the husband from within a tree trunk, and asked him why he looked so troubled. "Are you ill? Are you hungry? Tired?"

Though frightened by the presence of the goblin, the husband explained that he wasn't sick, tired or hungry. Instead, he told the goblin that he and his wife were poor, and that could not afford all of the fancy clothes, baubles, and other items that they wanted.

"If you are not hungry, cold, or ill, then rejoice because you are not poor!", said the goblin. 

"But I am poor! A man with little or no gold is poor!", explained the husband.

Upon hearing this, the goblin erupted into laughter. He then produced a hen, and explained to the husband that this hen was magical. Every morning, it would produce a golden egg. The goblin offered the hen to the husband, but warned that it would not provide the happiness and contentment that he sought.

The husband quickly took the hen from the goblin and ran home to his wife. Though she didn't believe that the hen was magical, she could at least use the eggs to make a nice omelet, she thought to herself. 

Early the next morning the hen began to cluck, and shortly after, a huge, bright golden egg appeared beneath it! The couple was ecstatic as they held the egg in their hands, but their mood quickly turned sour.

"Well... it seems we'll have to wait until tomorrow for another egg. It will take many weeks before we have enough eggs to be the richest in town. That must be why the goblin laughed when he gave me the hen.", the husband said.

The wife replied, "I've always heard that hens already have all the eggs they will lay inside of them... if this is true, why do we not kill the hen and take all of the eggs at once!" The husband agreed, and without hesitation, the couple killed the poor hen, and opened up her body. To their dismay, they saw that the there were no eggs inside. They then began to weep, for they realized that through their own greed and stupidity, they had lost forever the hen that laid the golden eggs.

- While held in the party's inventory, this hen will produce one golden egg per day.

Hearing a low moan, you turn and see Beno stirring. It seems that, somehow, he is still alive. The sight of his sniveling face is enough to send you past the point of no return. You give into your dark nature, and transform into the Slayer. His pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears, and you rip his heart from his chest. You throw his lifeless body across the room, and begin to eat his still-beating heart.

The taste and gore does little to satiate your bloodlust. You want more. You need more! This is who you are, you think to yourself. Why did you ever resist this kind of power? It's your birthright! 

You make your way out of the Undercity, and into the Thieves' Maze. With ease, you tear through wall after wall, and make it into the Guild. Their feeble attempts to stop you prove fruitless, and you gleefully rip them limb from limb. The screams are heard throughout the city as you continue to decimate the Thieves' Guild. You make your way out into the street and head toward the Ducal Palace. Those foolish enough to remain in your path are easily swept aside.

Upon entering the palace, you are quickly set upon by the Flaming Fist. Even their specially-trained Valiants and Wizards are not enough to stop you. You find the chamber where the Dukes are cowering, and you hear a scream — not from the Dukes, but from someone far more important to you... Rohma. The sight of Schael's daughter crying in terror is enough to snap you out of your murderous reverie. The transformation is undone, and the Dukes look at you, speechless and in horror. You tell Rohma that you are sorry; sorry for not protecting her mother, and sorry for what you have done. 

Rohma and the Dukes are rushed out of the room. You beg one of the surviving Valiants to end your life, and they are happy to oblige. Your life flashes before your eyes as you feel the blade of the mighty halberd slice through your neck. Candlekeep. Imoen and Gorion. The mines of Nashkel. Sarevok. The first time you and Schael met. Rohma. The Siege of Dragonspear. Irenicus. All of your triumphs, and all of your defeats. Your last memory is of Schael, and how happy you were when she agreed to marry you.

Your head hits the floor with a dull thud. The nightmare is over, both for you, and for the city of Baldur's Gate.~ [xalcrb09]

During one of the caravan's many stops, you visit Captain Corwin's wagon. Unsurprisingly, she is quite energetic and eager to see her family again. In contrast, your initial excitement at the thought of returning to the city has turned into apprehension. The last time you were in Baldur's Gate, you were nearly executed for a crime you did not commit. Seeing your growing unease, the Captain tries to reassure you:

"The city and the Council will welcome you, I'm sure of it. You've nothing to worry about."

You spend much of the remainder of the journey pondering her words. They were meant to comfort you, but they did not. If nothing else, your experiences over these past months have taught you to hope for the best, but to expect the worst. With that thought in mind, the caravan driver makes the announcement:

"We have reached Wyrm's Crossing."

You recall the trepidation that you felt when you stepped out of the caravan onto Wyrm's Crossing. You were certain at the time that, somehow, fate would intervene for the worse, as it did so many times before.

It is your intention for them to move in with you to the Ducal Palace, but Schael has expressed some reservations. 

"You've been great with Rohma, but she needs a little more time."

Although you're not living together, the two of you spend a great deal of your free time with one another.

Moreover, with you out of the city, further attempts on your life won't place them, or any others, in danger.

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You awaken startled and in a cold sweat, and your restlessness has woken up Schael. Concerned, she gently caresses your chest, and tries to settle you down.

"More nightmares?"

You explain how they've been plaguing you these past nights. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. 
 
"Whatever happens, we'll face it together."

She lays her head down on your chest, and you begin to slowly run your fingers through her soft, dark hair. After a time you're able to calm down, and the two of you fall asleep in a tender, loving embrace.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has come to a halt. You and Schael get dressed and exit your wagon. The driver says that you've reached your destination, on the outskirts of the forest northwest of Saradush. The remainder of your journey will be on foot. As the party moves toward the forest, your nostrils are assailed by the acrid smoke. With your eyes watering, you look up and see that the sky is covered in a thick, gray haze. The fire giants have been busy.

You tell her of the nightmares that've been plaguing you of late. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. She places her hand on your shoulder to reassure you.

Pressured by Aun, who was seen as a hero by the citizens of Waterdeep, and fearful of an uprising by those still sympathetic to her, the leaders decided to exile her instead. Aun joined her, and the two of them lived a life of seclusion as they helped each other overcome the mental and psychological scars left behind from their experience in Avernus.

After the week-long celebration had ended, Schael, Rohma and Audamar moved in to the Ducal Palace to live with <CHARNAME>, who was finally free to pursue the life he'd dreamed with the woman he loved. Schael gave birth to healthy fraternal twins; a boy, Gorion, named after <CHARNAME>'s foster father, and a girl, Ilara, named after her late mother. <CHARNAME> excelled at fatherhood, and Rohma filled the role of a big sister wonderfully. Audamar, meanwhile, was ecstatic to watch his three grandchildren grow up together. 

The two lovers were finally married on the steps of Candlekeep, roughly two years after the birth of the twins. Imoen, Skie, and many of their adventuring companions were present to witness the ceremony, as were Flaming Fist officials and local and foreign dignitaries. Included among these were the Grand Dukes, as well as officials from Waterdeep, Daggerford, Amn and Tethyr. Even some old friends from their coalition days attended, including Glint, Voghiln, Mizhena and Thaird, to name a few.

Schael stayed on with the Flaming Fist, eventually rising to the rank of Colonel before retiring to spend more time with her family. After the death of Duke Silvershield, <CHARNAME> was elected as the new Grand Duke, and he helped lead Baldur's Gate to a new era of peace and prosperity. Schael and <CHARNAME> proved inseparable, and they lived out their years in peace and contentment. The couple watched with delight as their children, and grandchildren, grew up to become well-regarded leaders in their respective fields. 

The happy family was never troubled by Beno or his associates ever again.~

@5008 = ~The way back to the underground river has been blocked by tons of fallen rock, perhaps due to an explosion of some sort.~
@5009 = ~When pressed to reveal her past, Caelar tells a tale repeated a thousand times over in her mind. As a child, Caelar Argent labored under the high expectations that came with her semi-divine heritage. Her early life in a monastery of the Order of the Aster was a hard one as Caelar's temperamental nature did not fit comfortably with the Asters' devotion to discipline. She believed, even then, that she was destined for great things. One day, alone in the chapter house library, she attempted to grow her powers by reading from a tome of forbidden knowledge. Instead she unwittingly opened a gate to the realm of the devil Belhifet. Caelar's soul should have been forfeit, but her uncle, Aun Argent, offered himself to the devil prince and was pulled down into the Nine Hells in his niece's place. Caelar never forgot his sacrifice. She vowed that someday, somehow, she would find a way to rescue her uncle from the pit of Avernus... and she was successful, though at great cost. You sense the suffering she endured in Avernus has changed her, though for better or worse, you cannot tell. What you are certain of is her commitment to making amends for the wanton death and destruction caused by her ill-fated crusade.~

@5019 =~Merely having this weapon on your person makes you fills you with a sense of dread. Holding it in your hand, you can almost hear the whispers of the souls trapped within. The gem mounted in the hilt seems to have an inner light of some sort, though how it can have such illuminations and still be so deathly black at its core, you do not know.

The dagger contains, among others, the soul of Major Corwin's former lover, Beno Famari. A group of Lathanderian clergymen attempted to restore his soul to his body, but were unsuccessful. Their plan — and Beno's body — quite literally blew up in their face, after they'd reanimated the corpse with the soul of a demon that'd been trapped in the dagger.~

@5021 = ~This magical cloak was gifted to Caelar Argent by one of her trusted lieutenants shortly before the start of her ill-fated crusade.

Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.

Her early life in a monastery of the Order of the Aster was a hard one as Caelar's temperamental nature did not fit comfortably with the Asters' devotion to discipline. She believed, even then, that she was destined for great things. One day, alone in the chapterhouse library, she attempted to grow her powers by reading from a tome of forbidden knowledge. Instead she unwittingly opened a gate to the realm of the devil Belhifet. Caelar's soul should have been forfeit, but her uncle, Aun Argent, offered himself to the devil prince and was pulled down into the Nine Hells in his niece's place. Caelar never forgot his sacrifice. She vowed that someday, somehow, she would find a way to rescue her uncle from the pit of Avernus. After more than a decade in seclusion, she made contact with the Revered Brother Hephernaan. He offered her a path to Avernus, but walking it would not be easy. She would, he claimed, require three things: an army to fight the legions of the Nine Hells, possession of Dragonspear Castle, and the divine blood that was the key to opening the portal beneath the castle...~

(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Healing 
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The Cure Critical Wounds spell is a very potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell. The priest lays <PRO_HISHER> hands upon a creature and heals 27 points of damage from wounds or other injuries. The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those not living.~

(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This unique ability allows Caelar to hurl a bolt of divine energy at an enemy once per day, dealing them 5d6 points of magic damage. Undead creatures and fiends are particularly susceptible to the bolt's effects, suffering double damage when they are struck. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this ability.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1

Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 8-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes total, impenetrable darkness. Neither normal nor magical light works in the area of effect. All vision (including infravision) is severely limited; anyone hostile caught in the area of effect is for all practical purposes blinded as per the 1st-level wizard spell. Creatures that leave the area covered by darkness will have their vision restored after 1 round.~

He favored purple clothing, believing it was a color the god preferred, and he crafted this belt to match his ensemble. The thief was eventually caught and killed on one of his missions and the belt confiscated by the city guard. The next night, the belt vanished from a locked chest in the guardhouse, though, whisked away by Mask so that it could continue to serve the god's ends. Even today, the belt often finds its way into the path of those who will put it to good use.

The pouches attached to the belt contain a number of small tools, wires, picks, and blades that can be used to pick locks and disable traps.

Bloodied and wild-eyed, clutching Lady Brightsworn's helm in his hands, he relayed a tale of the nightmarish warrens the group had found and the vampire who culled them from their group, slaughtering them one by one.

Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches.

@11175 = ~Cornugon's Revenge +2~
@11176 = ~Hide armor is made from the thick hide of a very large animal (an elephant for example) or from many layers of normal leather from common animals, like cows. Hide armor is far too bulky, inflexible and heavy to be used much in advanced human cultures. However, among the barbaric humanoid masses throughout the dark forests and misty jungles of the world, hide armor is common. Even though it does offer more protection than leather armor, one must get by the offensive odor and shoddy appearance in order to wear it effectively. Even though Thieves can wear this armor, it has a negative effect on their abilities.

@11177 = ~The devil Thel’blax was a scourge against the armies of the Abyss until he was assassinated by the servants of his own master, Dispater. With his final breath, Thel’blax cursed his own body to never lie still even in death. When his body was carried to the Iron Tower, Thel’blax’s horns and barbs continued to thrash about as though alive.

The cursed cornugon’s body was dismantled by his peers, in the hopes that destroying him would end the curse; but the disparate pieces of Thel’blax’s body continued to prick and tear at any who approached. At last, Dispater ordered his ironsmiths to forge the pieces into a suit of armor, intending to use it as a means of torturing insubordinates. Inevitably, the armor fell into the hands of intrepid (if foolhardy) adventurers, who then brought the piece to Faerûn.

Even now, the curse of Thel’blax affects the armor, causing its barbs to sink painfully into the flesh of anyone wearing it. It provides a measure of protection, behaving like hide armor, and even allows the wearer to benefit from Thel’blax’s resilience; but the constant stinging and flaying from the cornugon’s still-living barbs make this armor unsuitable for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach.
