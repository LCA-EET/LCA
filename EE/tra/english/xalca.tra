@1003=~I should be safe here. In the mean time, you have quite the task ahead of you. If I'm right, the Iron Throne is going to stage a coup. I fear that Nederlok, Corwin and the others won't return in time.  You're the only ones who'll be able to stop the coup.~
@1004=~I am again in your debt. That creature has kept me helpless for too long. Perhaps if I hadn't been incapacitated, I might have been able to prevent Scar's death. *cough* Angelo will soon hear of my recovery. It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the Harbor Master's building — he is a good friend of mine. I can rest there, and send word to Nederlok and Corwin to return to the city immediately. Their loyalty is beyond reproach, and they can retake control of the Fist while I recover. Take this letter; I managed to filch it off Rashad when he was "caring" for me. From what I read of it, it seems that Sarevok has dire plans for the city. I fear for the lives of my fellow Dukes, Liia and Belt. If they were to die, Sarevok would take over the city. You must find Slythe and Krystin, and stop them... *cough* Hurry! We must make haste.~

Such a weasel he is. I am surprised he has the support of the troops. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. You've heard of him, right? With Entar dead, the other Dukes have called an emergency election. Sarevok is the front-runner, and his stand against Amn is very popular. Imagine how much pull he will have if he actually has the Flaming Fist in his back pocket.~

@1007=~There's trouble in the Fist, <CHARNAME>, big trouble. Duke Eltan's fallen sick and Scar was killed, supposedly in a simple robbery but I have my doubts... It's all Angelo, he's making a power grab, taking control of the Fist and, with Scar gone and Nederlok sent on some bogus errand up north, there's nothing to stop him! I've seen him paying visits to the Iron Throne, too, and I don't like it one bit... There are some of us that are still loyal to Eltan and, lucky for you, I happen to be one of them. Please, for your sake and ours, keep your head down and, if you get the chance, sniff around the Iron Throne's base. If you can find a way to talk to Duke Eltan, even better, but they're keeping him in the middle of Fist headquarters... Damn it, Angelo will pay dearly for this and I hope it's soon...~

By the time you read this, you'll have departed the city. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to see you one last time before you left. When Belt, Eltan and Jannath made the decision to exile you, the Fist was put on high alert to prevent Entar and his associates from trying to take matters into their own hands. 

You now have the time you need to find some way to prove your innocence. If you're able to recover the Soultaker dagger, you must send it to me. The wizards believe they can restore Skie, but only if the dagger is in their possession. Once restored, she can corroborate your account of what happened on that night in Dragonspear. With your innocence established, love, we'll be together once again.    

I've enclosed my amulet with this letter. Wear it and know that I love you, always.

@3142=~This is the letter you plan to send to Captain Corwin in Baldur's Gate. You will need to speak to the Athkatla magistrate in order to have it delivered.

My love,

I pray this letter finds you, Rohma and your father well. There is much that I need to tell you. After being forced to depart Baldur’s Gate, our party was set upon by assassins and quickly incapacitated. We were delivered to Athkatla and held captive in the stronghold of a mad wizard named Irenicus – the very same “Hooded Man” that we encountered during the Dragonspear campaign. My recollection of events from that point is hazy… I do know that we were tortured and experimented upon for purposes that are unclear to me. We were not all fortunate to escape the wizard’s enclave with our lives. The bastard murdered Khalid and Dynaheir. By the time we found their corpses, nothing could be done to resurrect them.

While fleeing the stronghold, I came upon the dagger that is enclosed with this letter. I believe that this is the very same Soultaker Dagger that was used to murder Skie; if I am correct, the city priests can use it to restore Skie’s soul to her body and perform the resurrection. Please take the dagger to the city priests as soon as you are able. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder. 

After our escape, Imoen and Irenicus were abducted by the Cowled Wizards for unsanctioned use of magical power within the city. They were taken to a prison for magic practitioners called Spellhold. I must venture forth to Spellhold, rescue Imoen, and exact my revenge on Irenicus. The mage will pay for what he did to Khalid and Dynaheir, for framing me for Skie’s murder, for my exile from the city, and for keeping us apart. I will see you again, my love, once my innocence is established and this matter with Irenicus is resolved.

Yours always,

I have reason to believe that the dagger included with this letter is the very same Soultaker Dagger that was used to murder Skie Silvershield. If I am correct, the city priests can use it to restore Skie’s soul to her body and perform the resurrection. Please take the dagger to the city priests as soon as you are able. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder. The dagger belongs to a mad wizard named Irenicus.

@4001=~The Hen that Laid the Golden Egg~
@4002=~Legend tells of a couple that was renowned throughout the town for their insatiable greed. One day, a playful goblin who was passing through overheard the townsfolk speak of just how greedy this husband and wife were. Wanting to learn if the rumors of their greed were true, the goblin decided to pay them a visit. 

The goblin appeared to the husband from within a tree trunk, and asked him why he looked so troubled. "Are you ill? Are you hungry? Tired?"

Though frightened by the presence of the goblin, the husband explained that he wasn't sick, tired or hungry. Instead, he told the goblin that he and his wife were poor, and that could not afford all of the fancy clothes, baubles, and other items that they wanted.

"If you are not hungry, cold, or ill, then rejoice because you are not poor!", said the goblin. 

"But I am poor! A man with little or no gold is poor!", explained the husband.

Upon hearing this, the goblin erupted into laughter. He then produced a hen, and explained to the husband that this hen was magical. Every morning, it would produce a golden egg. The goblin offered the hen to the husband, but warned that it would not provide the happiness and contentment that he sought.

The husband quickly took the hen from the goblin and ran home to his wife. Though she didn't believe that the hen was magical, she could at least use the eggs to make a nice omelet, she thought to herself. 

Early the next morning the hen began to cluck, and shortly after, a huge, bright golden egg appeared beneath it! The couple was ecstatic as they held the egg in their hands, but their mood quickly turned sour.

"Well... it seems we'll have to wait until tomorrow for another egg. It will take many weeks before we have enough eggs to be the richest in town. That must be why the goblin laughed when he gave me the hen.", the husband said.

The wife replied, "I've always heard that hens already have all the eggs they will lay inside of them... if this is true, why do we not kill the hen and take all of the eggs at once!" The husband agreed, and without hesitation, the couple killed the poor hen, and opened up her body. To their dismay, they saw that the there were no eggs inside. They then began to weep, for they realized that through their own greed and stupidity, they had lost forever the hen that laid the golden eggs.

Abilities:
- While held in the party's inventory, this hen will produce one golden egg per day.

@4005=~Dragonspear Medal~
@4006=~The emblem of Dragonspear castle is depicted in the center of this heavy, golden medallion. The embroidery surrounding the emblem beautifully portrays the battle standards of Daggerford, Waterdeep, and Baldur's Gate — the three cities which formed the coalition that put an end to Caelar Argent's mad and woefully destructive crusade. The inscription on the back of the medal reads as follows:

'Awarded to <CHARNAME>, champion of the Sword Coast, for exceptional courage and gallantry during the Dragonspear campaign.'

The medallion is enchanted to increase the wearer's resilience against magical attacks.

@4011=~Ring of Mind Shielding~
@4012=~This powerful ring affords its wearer complete protection against mind altering effects. It is rumored that dying while wearing such a ring will transfer one's soul into it. You aren't eager to find out if the rumors are in fact true.

Abilities
- Immunity to fear, confusion, feeblemind, charm and domination.~
@4013=~Beno's Head~
@4014=~This is the severed head of Schael Corwin's ex-lover, Beno Famari. He was killed after he tried to use his own daughter, Rohma, as bait in an attempt to lure you and Major Corwin to your deaths. Although he's been resurrected several times in the past, you surmise that it will be difficult for his benefactors to do so again, now that his head has been separated from his body.

Alas, poor Beno! You knew him well...

Well, not really.~
@4015=~Merely having this weapon on your person makes you fills you with a sense of dread. Holding it in your hand, you can almost hear the whispers of the souls trapped within. The gem mounted in the hilt seems to have an inner light of some sort, though how it can have such illuminations and still be so deathly black at its core, you do not know.

The dagger contains, among others, the soul of Major Corwin's former lover, Beno Famari.~
@4016=~Though this appears to be the Soultaker dagger, it is different somehow. It doesn't feel as heavy as it did, and you don't feel that palpable sense of dread that you did when you found it in Amn. The gem in the hilt is dark and lifeless. Odd.~

@4098=~The battle is over. Rohma was saved, but at the cost of the woman you love. You have no hope of bringing her back. Overcome by grief, you fall to your hands and knees, and scream in agony. Hearing a low moan, you turn and see Beno stirring. It seems that, somehow, he is still alive. The sight of his sniveling face is enough to send you past the point of no return. You give into your dark nature, and transform into the Slayer. His pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears, and you rip his heart from his chest. You throw his lifeless body across the room, and begin to eat his still-beating heart.

The taste and gore does little to satiate your bloodlust. You want more. You need more! This is who you are, you think to yourself. Why did you ever resist this kind of power? It's your birthright! 

You make your way out of the Undercity, and into the Thieves' Maze. With ease, you tear through wall after wall, and make it into the Guild. Their feeble attempts to stop you prove fruitless, and you gleefully rip them limb from limb. The screams are heard throughout the city as you continue to decimate the Thieves' Guild. You make your way out into the street and head toward the Ducal Palace. Those foolish enough to remain in your path are easily swept aside.

Upon entering the palace, you are quickly set upon by the Flaming Fist. Even their specially-trained Valiants and Wizards are not enough to stop you. You find the chamber where the Dukes are cowering, and you hear a scream — not from the Dukes, but from someone far more important to you... Rohma. The sight of Schael's daughter crying in terror is enough to snap you out of your murderous reverie. The transformation is undone, and the Dukes look at you, speechless and in horror. You tell Rohma that you are sorry; sorry for not protecting her mother, and sorry for what you have done. 

Rohma and the Dukes are rushed out of the room. You beg one of the surviving Valiants to end your life, and they are happy to oblige. Your life flashes before your eyes as you feel the blade of the mighty halberd slice through your neck. Candlekeep. Imoen and Gorion. The mines of Nashkel. Sarevok. The first time you and Schael met. Rohma. The Siege of Dragonspear. Irenicus. All of your triumphs, and all of your defeats. Your last memory is of Schael, and how happy you were when she agreed to marry you.

Your head hits the floor with a dull thud. The nightmare is over, both for you, and for the city of Baldur's Gate.~ [xalcrb09]

@4101=~The Return to Baldur's Gate~
@4102=~You, Schael, and the rest of your companions board the elvish caravan and begin the journey back to Baldur's Gate. The long journey provides the necessary time and privacy to have some frank, and often difficult, conversations concerning your relationship. Certain aspects, including living and security arrangements, your role in parenting Rohma, and dealing with your celebrity, are left unclear. What is certain is that the love you share for one another has never been stronger, and that you are both fully committed to making the relationship work. 

Your excitement at the thought of returning to Baldur's Gate gradually turns to apprehension as the caravan moves closer to its destination. You were, after all, forced to leave the city under some very dark circumstances, and many wanted to see you executed. Seeing your growing unease, your love tries to reassure you:

"The city and the Council will welcome you. I'm sure of it. You've nothing to worry about."

Her words should comfort you, but they do not. If nothing else, your experiences over these past months have taught you to hope for the best, but to expect the worst. With that thought in mind, your hear the caravan driver make the announcement:

"We have reached Wyrm's Crossing."  

With Schael's hand in yours, you take a deep breath and step out of your wagon. A group of Flaming Fist officers and city officials approach as you stand on the bridge.~  [xalcrb02]
@4103=~At last!

You, Captain Corwin and the rest of your companions board the elvish caravan and begin the journey back to Baldur's Gate. The long trek affords you much time for some well-deserved rest and relaxation, which you are more than eager to take advantage of. Moreover, you finally have a chance to reflect on all that's happened since you left for Dragonspear many months ago... all of the twists and turns, your triumphs and defeats... perhaps now, things will settle down, and you'll be free to live your life on your terms. 

During one of the caravan's many stops, you visit Captain Corwin's wagon. Unsurprisingly, she is quite energetic and eager to see her family again. In contrast, your initial excitement at the thought of returning to the city has turned into apprehension. The last time you were in Baldur's Gate, you were nearly executed for a crime you did not commit. Seeing your growing unease, the Captain tries to reassure you:

"The city and the Council will welcome you, I'm sure of it. You've nothing to worry about."

You spend much of the remainder of the journey pondering her words. They were meant to comfort you, but they did not. If nothing else, your experiences over these past months have taught you to hope for the best, but to expect the worst. With that thought in mind, you hear the caravan driver make the announcement:

"We have reached Wyrm's Crossing."  

You take a deep breath and step out of the wagon. A group of Flaming Fist officers and city officials approach as you stand on the bridge.~  [xalcrb01]
@4104=~The week long festival held by the Dukes in your honor was a spectacle that you'll never forget. Food, drink, song and dance were shared by all, rich and poor alike, and you experienced the wholehearted adoration of the city. In the weeks that followed, you slowly began to embrace your new role as the city's protector — the Defender of Baldur's Gate. Though you miss your days of adventuring, you cannot deny that for the first time in your adult life, you feel a true sense of belonging, as though this city is where you are meant to be...

You recall the trepidation that you felt when you stepped out of the caravan onto Wyrm's Crossing. You were certain at the time that, somehow, fate would intervene for the worse, as it did so many times before. It seems now that you've been able to escape your father's shadow, and that you're finally free to live your life on your terms...

To that end, you continue your friendship with Major Corwin. Though you don't see each other as often as you once did, your bond remains strong. Tonight, you've invited her to dinner at The Three Old Kegs, the very same tavern where the two of you shared a drink before embarking on the Dragonspear campaign...~ [xalcrb04]

Though you miss your days of adventuring, you cannot deny that for the first time in your adult life, you feel a true sense of belonging, as though this city is where you are meant to be...

You recall the trepidation that you felt when you stepped out of the caravan onto Wyrm's Crossing. You were certain at the time that, somehow, fate would intervene for the worse, as it did so many times before. It seems now that you've been able to escape your father's shadow, and that you're finally free to live your life on your terms...

To that end, you continue your courtship of Schael Corwin. The love you share for one another has continued to grow. Over these past weeks, you've begun to build a good relationship with her young daughter, Rohma, and you sense that her father is finally warming up to you. It is your intention for them to move in with you to the Ducal Palace, but Schael has expressed some reservations. 

"You've been great with Rohma, but she needs a little more time."

Although you're not living together, the two of you spend a great deal of your free time with one another. Tonight is a date night, and you've decided to take Schael to dinner at The Three Old Kegs, the very same tavern where the two of you shared a drink before embarking on the Dragonspear campaign...~ [xalcrb03]
@4107=~The Journey to Saradush~
@4108=~Your party boards the caravan for the long trek to Saradush. During the journey, your thoughts wander to Rohma and Audamar. They were nearly killed because of who, and what you are. This is a grim reminder that anyone close to you will always be at risk. At least now, the two of them are safe within the Ducal Palace, under the watchful eye of the Flaming Fist. Moreover, with you out of the city, further attempts on your life won't place them, or any others, in danger.

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You awaken startled and in a cold sweat, and your restlessness has woken up Schael. Concerned, she gently caresses your chest, and tries to settle you down.

"More nightmares?"

You explain how they've been plaguing you these past nights. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. 
 
"Whatever happens, we'll face it together."

She lays her head down on your chest, and you begin to slowly run your fingers through her soft, dark hair. After a time you're able to calm down, and the two of you fall asleep in a tender, loving embrace.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has come to a halt. You and Schael get dressed and exit your wagon. The driver says that you've reached your destination, on the outskirts of the forest northwest of Saradush. The remainder of your journey will be on foot. As the party moves toward the forest, your nostrils are assailed by the acrid smoke. With your eyes watering, you look up and see that the sky is covered in a thick, gray haze. The fire giants have been busy.

The forest, and the besieged city beyond it, await.~ [xalcrb07]

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You wake startled and in a cold sweat. Since the caravan has stopped for the night, you step outside of your wagon for some fresh air. While outside, you see Schael sitting next to a pond. She stands as you approach, and gestures to you.

"Couldn't sleep either, eh?"

You tell her of the nightmares that've been plaguing you of late. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. She places her hand on your shoulder to reassure you. 

"Whatever happens, we'll face it together."

After some idle chatter, you return to your wagons to get some sleep.

Your mind drifts to Schael. You fondly remember your last romantic evening with her, and you're eager to return to her warm, tender embrace. Though it pains you greatly to be apart from her, you're sure that you made the right decision in leaving her behind to protect the city, and her family. Furthermore, you've made good use of the time alone to steel yourself for what will likely be your most difficult challenge yet.

@5001=~After leaving <CHARNAME>'s company, Caelar began the long journey back to Waterdeep, determined to face justice for the crimes that she and her soldiers had committed during the crusade. Upon her arrival in the city, she was detained and interrogated by the Waterdhavian authorities, who were stunned to learn of what had transpired in Avernus. 

In spite of the suffering that she'd already endured and her actions in helping <CHARNAME> defeat the Bhaalspawn terrorizing Tethyr, she was sentenced to death by hanging. On hearing this, Aun Argent pleaded with the city leaders to spare his niece. Pressured by Aun, who was seen as a hero by the citizens of Waterdeep, and fearful of an uprising by those still sympathetic to her, the leaders decided to exile her instead. Aun joined her, and the two of them lived a life of seclusion as they helped each other overcome the mental and psychological scars left behind from their experience in Avernus. 

When Aun passed a few years after her exile, Caelar set out on her own and became a wanderer of sorts, righting wrongs and helping people wherever she went. Many believe the Shining Lady is still out there, working steadfastly to atone for her sins.~
@5002=~Schael and <CHARNAME> received a hero's welcome upon their return to Baldur's Gate. After the week-long celebration had ended, Schael, Rohma and Audamar moved in to the Ducal Palace to live with <CHARNAME>, who was finally free to pursue the life he'd dreamed with the woman he loved. Schael gave birth to healthy fraternal twins; a boy, Gorion, named after <CHARNAME>'s foster father, and a girl, Ilara, named after her late mother. <CHARNAME> excelled at fatherhood, and Rohma filled the role of a big sister wonderfully. Audamar, meanwhile, was ecstatic to watch his three grandchildren grow up together. 

The two lovers were finally married on the steps of Candlekeep, roughly two years after the birth of the twins. Imoen, Skie, and many of their adventuring companions were present to witness the ceremony, as were Flaming Fist officials and local and foreign dignitaries. Included among these were the Grand Dukes, as well as officials from Waterdeep, Daggerford, Amn and Tethyr. Even some old friends from their coalition days attended, including Glint, Voghiln, Mizhena and Thaird, to name a few.

Schael stayed on with the Flaming Fist, eventually rising to the rank of Colonel before retiring to start her own archery academy. The academy quickly gained renown, and under her instruction and leadership it produced some of the finest sharpshooters that the Sword Coast had ever seen. After the death of Duke Silvershield, <CHARNAME> was elected as the new Grand Duke, and he helped lead Baldur's Gate to a new era of peace and prosperity. Schael and <CHARNAME> proved inseparable, and they lived out their years in peace and contentment. The couple watched with delight as their children, and grandchildren, grew up to become well-regarded leaders in their respective fields.

@5009=~When pressed to reveal her past, Caelar tells a tale repeated a thousand times over in her mind. As a child, Caelar Argent labored under the high expectations that came with her semi-divine heritage. Her early life in a monastery of the Order of the Aster was a hard one as Caelar's temperamental nature did not fit comfortably with the Asters' devotion to discipline. She believed, even then, that she was destined for great things. One day, alone in the chapter house library, she attempted to grow her powers by reading from a tome of forbidden knowledge. Instead she unwittingly opened a gate to the realm of the devil Belhifet. Caelar's soul should have been forfeit, but her uncle, Aun Argent, offered himself to the devil prince and was pulled down into the Nine Hells in his niece's place. Caelar never forgot his sacrifice. She vowed that someday, somehow, she would find a way to rescue her uncle from the pit of Avernus... and she was successful, though at great cost.

The dagger contains, among others, the soul of Major Corwin's former lover, Beno Famari. A group of Lathanderian clergymen attempted to restore his soul to his body, but were unsuccessful.

@5029=~[The Personal Diary of Sarevok]Diary

14th of Eleint, 1365: Today Cormyr has instituted a ban against the Iron Throne from operating within their borders. While this is a great blow to the Iron Throne, it is the perfect opportunity for Rieltar to approach the Throne high council with his proposal. If things go well, we could begin the operation within the year.

25th of Marpenoth, 1365: Davaeorn has sent a message to Rieltar, informing him that the mine at Cloakwood has been drained and is ready for use. This revelation should help greatly in convincing the Throne high council.

2nd of Nightal, 1365: The Iron Throne council has agreed to support Rieltar's plan. He has been given all the resources he needs, as well as leadership of the project. I have expressed interest to my "father," and he has promised to include me within the operations along the Sword Coast. He mentioned Mother in our conversation: how I wasn't to be unfaithful to him as she had. He made it clear that I would suffer her fate if I was. His threats are weak and hollow, and I shall listen to them for only so long. I have decided to take this time to make my visit to Candlekeep. I have waited a long time to research the prophecies of Alaundo, and I must know if the dreams speak the truth. I will not believe the words of phantoms without proof, and the priest of Bhaal I confronted gave me nothing. He was old and died quickly in my grasp. If the words are true, I shall surely groom stronger acolytes than this.

11th of Ches, 1366: My research has gone well. The monks here at Candlekeep have been quite helpful. From what I have read, it would seem certain that the blood of Bhaal does indeed flow through my veins. His prophecies are (of course) ambiguous, but I think I understand them. He foresaw his coming death, and seeded his essence across the land. The children born as a result bear the marks of chaos, have power with no direction, and shall feel the blood of a god within them. The deaths they bring shall awaken the father, and through them he will rise. It does not explicitly say, but obviously this means that death wrought by the children will cause them to ascend. Fitting, and since the father was the Lord of Murder, proving one's worth must involve an act in accordance with his portfolio. I begin to see what I must do. Death on a god-like scale.

3rd of Tarsakh, 1366: The monk Gorion troubles me. He seems to have taken an interest in my readings. I must be careful to be more clandestine in my research. I wish I could simply kill him, but I doubt I could safely murder him within this damnable library.

11th of Tarsakh, 1366: I had a dream this night. My mother was talking to me, but as she did her face became bloated and discolored. Her voice became weaker as she spoke to me, telling me to save her from Rieltar. I could see the garrote cutting into her neck, but I did nothing. It was only a dream. 

27th of Tarsakh, 1366: I take my leave of Candlekeep now, and not a moment too soon, for I am sure that Gorion has perceived my heritage. One thing that I am certain of: <CHARNAME> is, in actuality, one of Bhaal's brood as well. <CHARNAME> has all the markings, and it would explain Gorion's curiosity in my studies. Though there is nothing I can do now, I will have to make certain to return and kill the little brat. It would be foolish of me to let one of my siblings live, especially one being brought up by the Harpers (and I am sure that is where Gorion's allegiances lie).

5th of Mirtul, 1366: Today I met with Rieltar in Baldur's Gate. The fool still insists on calling me his son, and for now I will let him. He assumes that I am loyal to him because he raised me. Well, loyal I am, but only as long as he is useful. He's set up a base in the mansion of a destitute noble family and says that everything is running smoothly. Mulahey has established himself at the mines of Nashkel, and his kobold minions should be already busily contaminating the iron ore. Only a few slaves have begun to mine out the ore at Cloakwood, though Rieltar assures me that once the bandit raids begin we'll have a steady supply of new slaves.

8th of Hammer, 1367: I met with the leaders of the Chill and Blacktalons. I have little liking for Ardenor, the leader of the Chill, but Taurgosz seems to be a man of his word. It is a good thing, as I'll have to work with these mercenaries for the rest of the year.

3rd of Tarsakh, 1368: Everything proceeds well. The ore coming from Nashkel has started to deteriorate, and my mercenaries have been doing a fine job of destroying any iron caravans on route to Baldur's Gate. Though some of my mercenaries have been captured, most think they work for the Zhents, so no trouble has fallen on the Iron Throne. I am sure that the Zhents at Darkhold won't be pleased to know that their name has been falsely used. I will have to be wary for Zhentish agents in the coming months.

28th of Tarsakh, 1368: I think I now have the time to deal with that old codger Gorion, and his little whelp. I will have to inform my men that I'll be gone for the next few weeks.

? of Mirtul
No time to write, but I must not neglect my journals so. The future dead must know of how the Lord of Murder again came to them. I shall hire a scribe when time allows. Things have not gone completely as I have planned, but I will still be able to salvage the situation. <CHARNAME> is on the move to Baldur's Gate; if I could maneuver the whelp to Candlekeep, then I would have the perfect scapegoat for my plan. My mortal "father," Rieltar, is there to meet with the Knights of the Shield. He has been blocking all my attempts to escalate the hostilities between Amn and Baldur's Gate, and these meetings will only serve to smooth relations. I must rid myself of them all and assume control of the Iron Throne myself. I cannot allow petty business and monetary concerns to interfere. Terribly sorry, "Father," but my true parentage calls and you are in my way. I shall be sure to instruct the doppelgangers in the exact manner Rieltar should die. I think a garrote would be perfect for the task.

12th of Eleasis: The plan to frame <CHARNAME> for the murder of my mortal father has succeeded. My spies informed me that <PRO_HESHE> was apprehended attempting to escape through the catacombs beneath Candlekeep. Angelo has sent a party of Fist enforcers to fetch him and deliver him to me.

26th of Eleasis: Dukes Silvershield and Eltan are dead; Silvershield died at the hands of the assassins Slythe and Krystin, and Eltan finally succumbed to the poison last evening. There are still those within the Fist that are loyal to him, and through they've yet to be rooted out, Angelo should have no difficulty marshaling the Fist for their eventual march upon Amn. I sense that Dukes Belt and Jannath suspect that my role in recent events is greater than what I've let on, but without evidence of wrongdoing they'll be unable to take any action. As for <CHARNAME>, my first official act as Grand Duke will be to preside over <PRO_HISHER> execution, scheduled for tomorrow morning.~

@5032=~Saving the city of Baldur's Gate, ending the threat posed by Caelar Argent and her mad crusade, venturing into the first of the nine hells and emerging victorious ... not to mention defeating the deranged wizard Jon Irenicus and preserving the Tree of Life... such heroic accomplishments are mere footnotes in the epic tale of <CHARNAME>, greatest of the children of Bhaal!~
@5033 = ~Aster's Edge +5~
@5034 = ~Legend tells that a powerful angelic being gifted this blade to a member of the Order of the Aster long ago. Details of the legend have been lost over time, but many believe the sword was a reward for slaying a monstrous fiend, perhaps even a balor. Delicate etchings of asters decorate the blade.

With the Eye of Tyr affixed to the pommel, the power of this magnificent weapon now matches its beauty. When drawn, the augmented blade pulses with an other-worldly glow, signifying its holy power.

Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

She believed, even then, that she was destined for great things. One day, alone in the chapterhouse library, she attempted to grow her powers by reading from a tome of forbidden knowledge. Instead she unwittingly opened a gate to the realm of the devil Belhifet. Caelar's soul should have been forfeit, but her uncle, Aun Argent, offered himself to the devil prince and was pulled down into the Nine Hells in his niece's place. Caelar never forgot his sacrifice. She vowed that someday, somehow, she would find a way to rescue her uncle from the pit of Avernus. After more than a decade in seclusion, she made contact with the Revered Brother Hephernaan. He offered her a path to Avernus, but walking it would not be easy. She would, he claimed, require three things: an army to fight the legions of the Nine Hells, possession of Dragonspear Castle, and the divine blood that was the key to opening the portal beneath the castle...~

(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Healing 
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The Cure Critical Wounds spell is a very potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell. The priest lays <PRO_HISHER> hands upon a creature and heals 27 points of damage from wounds or other injuries. The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those not living.~

(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This unique ability allows Caelar to hurl a bolt of divine energy at an enemy once per day, dealing them 5d6 points of magic damage. Undead creatures and fiends are particularly susceptible to the bolt's effects, suffering double damage when they are struck. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this ability.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1

Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 8-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes total, impenetrable darkness. Neither normal nor magical light works in the area of effect. All vision (including infravision) is severely limited; anyone hostile caught in the area of effect is for all practical purposes blinded as per the 1st-level wizard spell. Creatures that leave the area covered by darkness will have their vision restored after 1 round.~

All his burglaries were undertaken with prayers to Mask, and he hoarded his stolen goods at a hidden altar to the god of thieves. He favored purple clothing, believing it was a color the god preferred, and he crafted this belt to match his ensemble. The thief was eventually caught and killed on one of his missions and the belt confiscated by the city guard. The next night, the belt vanished from a locked chest in the guardhouse, though, whisked away by Mask so that it could continue to serve the god's ends. Even today, the belt often finds its way into the path of those who will put it to good use.

The pouches attached to the belt contain a number of small tools, wires, picks, and blades that can be used to pick locks and disable traps.

Bloodied and wild-eyed, clutching Lady Brightsworn's helm in his hands, he relayed a tale of the nightmarish warrens the group had found and the vampire who culled them from their group, slaughtering them one by one. Investigations into the City of the Dead uncovered some of the tunnels, but all had collapsed. Of the vampire, there was no trace.

The elves tracked the cult to their hiding place within the forest, where Olen eradicated the cultists for their murderous deeds.

Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.

When his body was carried to the Iron Tower, Thel’blax’s horns and barbs continued to thrash about as though alive.

The cursed cornugon’s body was dismantled by his peers, in the hopes that destroying him would end the curse; but the disparate pieces of Thel’blax’s body continued to prick and tear at any who approached. At last, Dispater ordered his ironsmiths to forge the pieces into a suit of armor, intending to use it as a means of torturing insubordinates. Inevitably, the armor fell into the hands of intrepid (if foolhardy) adventurers, who then brought the piece to Faerûn.

Even now, the curse of Thel’blax affects the armor, causing its barbs to sink painfully into the flesh of anyone wearing it. It provides a measure of protection, behaving like hide armor, and even allows the wearer to benefit from Thel’blax’s resilience; but the constant stinging and flaying from the cornugon’s still-living barbs make this armor unsuitable for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach.
