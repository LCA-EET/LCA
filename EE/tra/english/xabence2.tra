@1=~Corporal Duncan, allow me to present Caelar Argent, leader of the crusade. I summoned you here to take her into custody.~
@2=~Hmph. She looks to be in bad shape. She'll need some time to recover before she can stand trial. Very well.~
@3=~Caelar Argent! You are under arrest for the crimes of insurrection, murder, and the incitement of violence against the Grand Dukes. Do you understand the charges levied against you?~
@4=~I do.~
@6=~Very good. It's time, Caelar.~
@7=~Take her away, Corporal.~
@8=~Yes, Major.~
