@1=~Hello, there. Dun, ex-merchant at your service. How may I be of assistance?~
@2=~How exactly does one become an ex-merchant?~
@3=~Could you tell me where the good stores are in this city?~
@4=~Well, you start by becoming a merchant. Then you become a gambler. Then you bet your business on a game of dice. Then you lose. Voil√†, an ex-merchant. Next question?~
@5=~Could you tell me where the good stores are in town?~
@6=~I'm terribly sorry to hear that.~
@7=~There are no good shops in this city. Nope. None. Don't even think about it. Especially the ones run by the Seven Suns or the Merchants' League.~
@8=~No good shops? Why, that's ridiculous!~
@9=~What's wrong with the Seven Suns and the Merchants' League?~
@10=~Ridiculous? I don't believe the world of commerce could be otherwise. Bye now.~
@11=~I used to gamble with those fellows but something's not right. I'm in debt to them up to my ears but nothin's happening. No big guys with clubs knocking on my door in the middle of the night, no poison in my ale, nothing. It's like they've forgotten the whole thing. I saw my old buddy Al in the street the other day, looked him right in the eye, and he didn't even cuff me about the ears. Just started looking real nervous like he had forgotten his best friend's name at a party or something. Strange, I tell you.~
@12=~The Seven Suns
I met Dun the ex-merchant in the city streets today. He has some interesting suspicions about the Seven Suns and the Merchants' League, two mercantile groups here in Baldur's Gate. He is apparently quite in their debt financially, but, for some unknown reason, they have stopped pressuring him for repayment. Indeed, they seem almost frightened whenever he approaches them and tries to catch their eye. I cannot yet fathom the relevance of this to my investigation. Still, this whole affair has been motivated by greed, business, and money from the start. If merchant groups in the largest city in the region are acting suspicious, I had best take note...~
@13=~Nah, don't be. It's given me a whole new lease on life, I swear! I'm as light and as free and as, well... broke as the wind! See? Look at me fly!~
