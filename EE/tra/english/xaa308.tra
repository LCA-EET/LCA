@1=~What? I didn't do anything... just leave me alone!~
@2=~Hey, what do you want? I didn't do nothin'. Hey, what's that amulet you have there?~
@3=~Mom set you up to this, didn't she? All right, all right, it looks dumb, but I'll wear it. Tell my mom, Nadine, that I miss her, but I'm not comin' back. Tell her that I'll be safe. Bye-bye now.~
@4=~Nadine and Euric
Euric accepted Nadine's amulet but didn't seem too happy about it. He asked me to return to her with a message that he misses her.~
@5=~I ain't afraid of you!~
@6=~Say hi to my mom for me, could you? I'm still doing okay, but you can tell her I'll probably be coming home soon.~
