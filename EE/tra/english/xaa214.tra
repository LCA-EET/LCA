@1=~I've nothing of value here. Please leave my home as it is.~
@2=~The guards will ensure you leave! Do I call them, or do you leave now?~
@3=~Guards! Thieves! Murderers!~
@4=~I don't leave my home much, so there's little I know about what goes on within the city. Why don't you take this gold piece and enjoy yourself at the market square? There's all sorts of things to do there.~
@5=~Leave me! You've outstayed your welcome!~
