@1=~This is strange. Entar didn't say he was going to have guests over for food. I've only made servings to fit three. I guess I must make changes. Don't worry, you'll have a feast that you won't soon forget!~
@2=~Hello again, you'll have to excuse me, I'm quite busy.~
@3=~Would you like it if I whipped up some food for you right here and now? Come on friends, stay and try out my Sembian meatballs!~
@4=~Get out of my sight! I'll do nothing for you!~
