@3=~Back off lady, I don't have the time for you.~
@4=~My two sons, Percy and Timotey, were playing in the abandoned tower... I told them time and again to never go in there! Percy said that Timotey found some kind of figurine under a loose floorboard, and suddenly a giant lizard appeared! Percy was able to escape, but Timotey is still in there with the monster! You have to save him!~
@5=~Abandoned tower? You mean Ramazith's tower?~
@6=~Yes! Please, save my Timotey!~
