@1=~So, what can I help you with?~
@2=~We were sent here with the understanding that you did all of the hiring for the Iron Throne.~
@3=~We're looking for the leaders of the Iron Throne.~
@4=~We're the mercenaries who've been messing up all your operations these past weeks. Tell us everything you know or we'll kill you where you stand!~
@5=~I apologize. Someone has made a mistake; we are hiring no one at the moment. I hope there hasn't been too much inconvenience, but could you please leave now?~
@6=~And why would you be looking for them? Might I ask you who you are and what you're doing here?~
@7=~We're merchants in from Sembia. We have important news for your leader.~
@8=~We're merchants. We have just arrived from Cormyr, and have important news for your leader.~
@9=~We're mercenaries looking for a job. We were told that you were the person to talk to.~
@10=~Well, Rieltar isn't here right now. I'd suggest you find an inn and wait for his return from Candlekeep.~
@11=~From Cormyr? That is most interesting, considering that the Iron Throne is banned from operating there. What I really think is that you're spies. GUARDS!~
@12=~Wait! Don't kill me please! What do you want to know? I'll tell you anything.~
@13=~Where are your leaders?~
@14=~What are the Iron Throne's plans?~
@15=~Investigating the Iron Throne
The offices of the Iron Throne leaders are on the fifth floor of the building.~
@16=~Where are the offices of your leader?~
@17=~Theyâ€”they're at Candlekeep, at some important conference.~
@18=~I couldn't tell you that. I'm not privy to that kind of information. You-you'd have to ask Rieltar, Brunos, or Thaldorn.~
@19=~It's located on the fifth floor.~
@20=~Please leave, I promise not to tell anyone you're here.~
@21=~Do you mind? I'm a very busy man, and I don't need these constant interruptions.~
@22=~If you're looking for Rieltar and Brunos, you'd find them at Candlekeep. There's some sort of clandestine rendezvous at the library.~
@23=~A charmed merchant told us that the leaders of the Iron Throne were at Candlekeep.~
@24=~You're not welcome here! Get out or be thrown out!~
