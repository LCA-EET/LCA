@1=~I've no interest in talkin' to the likes of you, unless you loosen the strings of your purse a bit. Then I'll be happy to chat, and to lighten the heavy load you are burdened with.~
@2=~If you don't mind, I've nobles to mark and lighten.~
@3=~You'll be face to fist if you get in the way of me earning my rightful take on the street today!~
@4=~I've made a bit o' extra scratch from the pedestrian prey today, but I don't think I've much to say that you haven't heard before.~
@5=~If you are quite through drawing attention to me, I should like to make for some shadows now. Hard to blend with an unsuspecting crowd when the likes of you come barging up.~
