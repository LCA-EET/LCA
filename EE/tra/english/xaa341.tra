@1=~Out out OUT! I'll no be giving out scraps to fools wandering about tonight! I've a DUKE to cook for, so if you try to distract me you'll likely get a pot upside your head!~
@2=~Though I'm stuck in this here kitchen, it don't mean I haven't got rumors coming my way. From what I hear, Sarevok's the next Grand Duke fer sure.~
@3=~Out! And never darken my door again!~
