@1   = ~Hello friends. At least, I hope you are friends. Wouldn't want enemies barging into my home at all hours uninvited.~
@2   = ~Were you planning on staying in my home long? Only until the guard arrives, I'll wager.~
@3   = ~I don't leave my home much, so there's little I know about what goes on within the city. Why don't you take this gold piece and enjoy yourself at the market square? There's all sorts of things to do there.~
@4   = ~Leave me! You've outstayed your welcome!~
