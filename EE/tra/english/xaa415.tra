@1   = ~Wait a moment. Could you please tell me where I could find Rieltar? It's important that I speak to him. I've been given the run-around too long. Rieltar's damn son, Sarevok, seems to think he's in charge here.~
@2   = ~We must ask for a name before we go telling the whereabouts of Iron Throne high-ups.~
@3   = ~We have no clue, sorry.~
@4   = ~Damn it, is anyone competent here!~
@5   = ~I'm Nortuary, and your Iron Throne "high-up" answers to me! I've just arrived from Selgaunt in Sembia. The council wishes to know how things are faring. Now tell me where I can find Rieltar!~
@6   = ~Actually, we don't really know where he is at the moment. We apologize for any inconvenience we might have caused you.~
@7   = ~Rieltar's in the upper offices at the moment. If you go up there, I'm sure you'll catch him.~
@8   = ~Good! Finally, I get a straight answer.~
