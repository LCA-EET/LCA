@0 = ~Hey, Percy, look what I ... wait ... who're you?~
@1 = ~I'm <GABBER>. You must be Timotey. Your mother sent me to rescue you from the basilisk. How are you feeling?~
@2 = ~Uhh... I feel okay, I guess. I was playing with my brother, and I found this under a loose floorboard by the desk. I think... uh, I think you better take it.~
@3 = ~Can I go home now?~
@4 = ~Yes. Your mother and brother are waiting for you outside. Let's go.~
