@1=~I sense evil in your party, friend. I cannot allow you or your evil companions to threaten the good people of Baldur's Gate.~
@2=~Phandalyn
My party has been attacked by Phandalyn, an over-vigilant paladin loitering in one of Baldur's Gate's many seedy taverns. Mental note: when one depends on a party of evil, steer clear of muscle-bound paladins.~
@3=~Your party is free of the taint of evil. Please pass unmolested.~
@4=~Death to all who seek to harbor the emissaries of darkness!~
@5=~I trust your stay in the city has been uneventful.~
