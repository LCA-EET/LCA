@1=~Have you heard? The question of declaring war on Amn is being put before the Duke's Council!~
@2=~Oh, no! What do you think their decision will be?~
@3=~I wish to hear as little of this city's politics as I can. Go bring your news to a more willing audience.~
@4=~The dukes are too set in their ways, too comfortable there. This is all just part of their cat-and-mouse game with Amn to negotiate a better deal on the iron trade... Still, the suggestion of war has only been that until now: a suggestion, not an eventuality brought to the table to be considered...~
@5=~Well, at least you didn't shoot the messenger.~
