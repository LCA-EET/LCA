@1 = ~Those Iron Throne fellows are quite the secretive bunch. Sarevok, the foster son of their leader, is quite the charmer, though.~
@2 = ~Investigating the Iron Throne
Sarevok, son of one of the Iron Throne's leaders, has become increasingly popular in Baldur's Gate.~
@3 = ~I heard that Sarevok might be willing to donate a large portion of his coster's iron supplies to the city.~
@4 = ~I'll definitely vote for Sarevok in the coming election. He might be new, but he has a lot to add to the city.~
@5 = ~I do hope they catch those rapscallions that escaped from Candlekeep. From what I understand they were trying to frame the Iron Throne for what's really the fault of Amn. To think that Duke Eltan was trusting Amnian spies.~
@6 = ~I have a vested interest in the Seven Suns trading coster. It upsets me to no end how much they've lost to bandits over the past few weeks.~
@7 = ~作为出身名门的绅士，我很少屈尊参与平民的俗事。我怀疑我能告诉你的，对你并无多大用处。抱歉，朋友。~
@8 = ~别靠近我！我会把你打的落花流水，我会的！~
