@1 = ~It will be the darkest day ye have never seen before I don't have what ye need. Fer the right price, anyway.~
@2 = ~What will ye need today? Remember, cash or hit the bricks. I extend no credit, especially to new recruits.~
@3 = ~Off wit' ye now. I've counting to do.~
@4 = ~Alarm! Alarm! Snakes in our own guild! Take 'em alive so we can kill 'em slow!~
@5 = ~As a good friend, I must warn you: Magic use isn't appreciated in the guild, especially if it's used against guild members. I'll likely have to kill you once this parlor sorcery wears off.~
