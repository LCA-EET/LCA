@1 = ~Poor little thieves. You have chosen the wrong home to break into today. You do not rob from a simple merchant, but rather the master mage SUNIN! I will brook no excuses! Today is the day that you die, robbers!~
@2 = ~I know you said that you wouldn't tolerate excuses, but we have a real good one.~
@3 = ~Die, mage!~
@4 = ~Of course, I'll not be killing you alone. I have my servants to aid in the killing. They are but a teleport spell away.~
@5 = ~Such fury!~
