@1 = ~Sorry, milord, but my services have been reserved for the eve.~
@2 = ~Ooo, darling, you're probably looking for Schvantz. He's hanging out around here somewhere.~
@3 = ~A little while ago, darling, a man named Yago started renting out a room here every night. He became quite the regular. Lately though, he's become somewhat prone to violence. He's some sort of mage, so no one wants to deal with him. You're a great hero, darling. Why don't you take care of him?~
@4 = ~You'll get nothing from me!~
