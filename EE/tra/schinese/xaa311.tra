@1 = ~Hi, I'm Well-Adjusted Al, and my prices are sensible. I used to be called "Crazy Al," but therapy has convinced me that selling plate armor for 3 gold pieces and a small duck was no way to get ahead in business.~
@2 = ~Ooookay. Just show me what you have and I'll be on my way.~
@3 = ~Thanks, but no thanks. Get your hand off my arm. I'll be going now. Goodbye.~
