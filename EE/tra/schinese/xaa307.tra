@1 = ~Good eve! I am quite sure I don't need to inform you of the rules of conduct while in the Blade and Stars. Rest assured that your stay will be uneventful and restful.~
@2 = ~What kind of services do you offer here?~
@3 = ~We'll make sure to obey your "rules."~
@4 = ~Hello. I trust you'll be behaving yourselves while here? We are somewhat less tolerant of unruly guests than more... unrestrained neighboring Inns.~
@5 = ~What kind of services do you have to offer?~
@6 = ~We're an unruly bunch, so we'd better be on our way.~
@7 = ~I'll tell you straight out: We do not cater to unruly guests, and if you disturb any of the other patrons, you will be asked to leave. If you press the matter, you will be "assisted" to the door. For the good of all concerned, I am sure you will not let it go that far.~
@8 = ~If you're going to be so rude, my companions will just take leave of this place!~
@9 = ~Welcome back. The Blade and Stars stands ready to provide what e'er ye need.~
@10 = ~I fear we are not open to such as you. Begone lest the house guards escort you.~
