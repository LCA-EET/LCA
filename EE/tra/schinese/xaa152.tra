@4 = ~请你离开好吗？我并不想与低等人交往。~
@5 = ~尽管与低等人交往不太体面，但我发现你有一种无法抗拒的魅力。我愿意告诉你任何你想知道的事。或许你想听听我上次参加的舞会。那真是奇妙，我成了众人关注的焦点。~
@6 = ~I'll not have you near me!~
@7 = ~I've never been satisfied with the dresses made by Elma Spitwrack. The workmanship is shoddy and the material is coarse. I've never understood why she is considered so highly by the fashion establishment in Waterdeep. I think that a blind goblin could make a better dress.~
@8 = ~Most interesting... After combining mandrake and nightshade, the world slows down and rabbits steal my pants. Lord Engles suggests that an Avatar is to blame but I think he's talking rot.~
@9 = ~如果你不介意，我真觉得没必要和一群脏兮兮的冒险者说话。去别的地方玩你们的小剑和魔法游戏，但请不要在我身边。~
