Perhaps if I hadn't been incapacitated, I might have been able to prevent Scar's death. *cough* Angelo will soon hear of my recovery. It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the Harbor Master's building — he is a good friend of mine. I can rest there, and send word to Nederlok and Corwin to return to the city immediately. Their loyalty is beyond reproach, and they can retake control of the Fist while I recover. Take this letter; I managed to filch it off Rashad when he was "caring" for me. From what I read of it, it seems that Sarevok has dire plans for the city. I fear for the lives of my fellow Dukes, Liia and Belt. If they were to die, Sarevok would take over the city. You must find Slythe and Krystin, and stop them... *cough* Hurry! We must make haste.~

@1006 = ~They still have leadership. How effective it is, I do not know. With Marshal Nederlok sent on some training exercise up north, I hear Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control.

It's all Angelo, he's making a power grab, taking control of the Fist and, with Scar gone and Nederlok sent on some bogus errand up north, there's nothing to stop him! I've seen him paying visits to the Iron Throne, too, and I don't like it one bit... There are some of us that are still loyal to Eltan and, lucky for you, I happen to be one of them. Please, for your sake and ours, keep your head down and, if you get the chance, sniff around the Iron Throne's base. If you can find a way to talk to Duke Eltan, even better, but they're keeping him in the middle of Fist headquarters... Damn it, Angelo will pay dearly for this and I hope it's soon...~

现在，你拥有了证明自己清白所需的时间。如果你能找回夺魂者匕首，你必须将它交给我。巫师们相信，只要匕首在手，他们便能让史姬复苏。一旦她得以复原，便能证实你在龙矛堡那晚所经历的一切。亲爱的，一旦你的清白得以证实，我们便能再度团聚。

随信附上我的护身符。戴上它，我对你的爱，永远不变。

你的，

舍尔~
@2007 = ~<CHARNAME>,

By the time you read this, you'll have departed the city. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to see you one last time before you left. When Belt, Eltan and Jannath made the decision to exile you, the Fist was put on high alert to prevent Entar and his associates from trying to take matters into their own hands. 

You now have the time you need to find some way to prove your innocence. If you're able to recover the Soultaker dagger, you must send it to me. The wizards believe they can restore Skie, but only if the dagger is in their possession. Once restored, she can corroborate your account of what happened on that night in Dragonspear. You'll be able to return to the city once your innocence is established.   

Good luck to you, my friend. 

Regards,

My love,

I pray this letter finds you, Rohma and your father well. There is much that I need to tell you. After being forced to depart Baldur’s Gate, our party was set upon by assassins and quickly incapacitated. We were delivered to Athkatla and held captive in the stronghold of a mad wizard named Irenicus – the very same “Hooded Man” that we encountered during the Dragonspear campaign. My recollection of events from that point is hazy… I do know that we were tortured and experimented upon for purposes that are unclear to me. We were not all fortunate to escape the wizard’s enclave with our lives. The bastard murdered Khalid and Dynaheir. By the time we found their corpses, nothing could be done to resurrect them.

While fleeing the stronghold, I came upon the dagger that is enclosed with this letter. I believe that this is the very same Soultaker Dagger that was used to murder Skie; if I am correct, the city priests can use it to restore Skie’s soul to her body and perform the resurrection. Please take the dagger to the city priests as soon as you are able. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder. 

After our escape, Imoen and Irenicus were abducted by the Cowled Wizards for unsanctioned use of magical power within the city. They were taken to a prison for magic practitioners called Spellhold. I must venture forth to Spellhold, rescue Imoen, and exact my revenge on Irenicus. The mage will pay for what he did to Khalid and Dynaheir, for framing me for Skie’s murder, for my exile from the city, and for keeping us apart. I will see you again, my love, once my innocence is established and this matter with Irenicus is resolved.

Yours always,

邓肯下士，

我有理由相信，随信附上的匕首正是那把用来谋杀史姬·银盾的夺魂者匕首。如果我的猜测正确，城市牧师可以用它将史姬的灵魂恢复到她的身体中并进行复活。请尽快将匕首交给城市牧师。一旦史姬复活，她将能够证实我所知道的事实，即我并非她的谋杀者。这把匕首属于一个名叫艾瑞尼卡斯的疯狂巫师。他正是那个谋杀了史姬并诬陷我的人。放心，他将为他对史姬、博德之门城市、我的同伴以及我本人的罪行付出沉重的代价。

请代我向科温上尉和她的父亲问好。

此致，

@4002 = ~Legend tells of a couple that was renowned throughout the town for their insatiable greed. One day, a playful goblin who was passing through overheard the townsfolk speak of just how greedy this husband and wife were. Wanting to learn if the rumors of their greed were true, the goblin decided to pay them a visit. 

The goblin appeared to the husband from within a tree trunk, and asked him why he looked so troubled. "Are you ill? Are you hungry? Tired?"

Though frightened by the presence of the goblin, the husband explained that he wasn't sick, tired or hungry. Instead, he told the goblin that he and his wife were poor, and that could not afford all of the fancy clothes, baubles, and other items that they wanted.

"If you are not hungry, cold, or ill, then rejoice because you are not poor!", said the goblin. 

"But I am poor! A man with little or no gold is poor!", explained the husband.

Upon hearing this, the goblin erupted into laughter. He then produced a hen, and explained to the husband that this hen was magical. Every morning, it would produce a golden egg. The goblin offered the hen to the husband, but warned that it would not provide the happiness and contentment that he sought.

The husband quickly took the hen from the goblin and ran home to his wife. Though she didn't believe that the hen was magical, she could at least use the eggs to make a nice omelet, she thought to herself. 

Early the next morning the hen began to cluck, and shortly after, a huge, bright golden egg appeared beneath it! The couple was ecstatic as they held the egg in their hands, but their mood quickly turned sour.

"Well... it seems we'll have to wait until tomorrow for another egg. It will take many weeks before we have enough eggs to be the richest in town. That must be why the goblin laughed when he gave me the hen.", the husband said.

The wife replied, "I've always heard that hens already have all the eggs they will lay inside of them... if this is true, why do we not kill the hen and take all of the eggs at once!" The husband agreed, and without hesitation, the couple killed the poor hen, and opened up her body. To their dismay, they saw that the there were no eggs inside. They then began to weep, for they realized that through their own greed and stupidity, they had lost forever the hen that laid the golden eggs.

Abilities:
- While held in the party's inventory, this hen will produce one golden egg per day.

The embroidery surrounding the emblem beautifully portrays the battle standards of Daggerford, Waterdeep, and Baldur's Gate — the three cities which formed the coalition that put an end to Caelar Argent's mad and woefully destructive crusade. The inscription on the back of the medal reads as follows:

'Awarded to <CHARNAME>, champion of the Sword Coast, for exceptional courage and gallantry during the Dragonspear campaign.'

The medallion is enchanted to increase the wearer's resilience against magical attacks.

唉，可怜的贝诺！你对他了如指掌……
嗯，其实并没有。~
@4015 = ~仅仅拿着这把武器便能感受到一股令人不安的气息。握在手中，仿佛能听到被囚禁灵魂的窃窃私语。匕首柄上的宝石似乎散发着内在的光芒，然而它那深邃黑暗的核心让人不解，这种光芒是如何存在的。

这把匕首中，囚禁着科温少校的前恋人贝诺·法马里的灵魂等众多灵魂。~

你从地下城走出，踏入盗贼的迷宫。你轻易地摧毁一堵堵墙壁，直捣盗贼公会的心脏。他们微不足道的抵抗对你毫无作用，你欣喜若狂地将他们一一撕裂。你的暴行让整个城市的上空回荡着尖叫声，你继续无情地摧毁盗贼公会。你走上街头，朝公爵宫殿前进，那些愚蠢地挡在你路上的人轻易地被你清除。

进入宫殿后，焰拳迅速向你发起攻击。即便是他们特别训练的勇士和巫师也无法阻止你。你找到了公爵们藏身的房间，却听到了一声尖叫——不是来自公爵们，而是对你来说更为重要的人……罗玛。看到舍尔的女儿在恐惧中哭泣，足以让你从杀戮的迷梦中惊醒。你的变身解除了，公爵们惊恐地看着你，哑口无言。你向罗玛道歉；因为没有保护她的母亲，也因为你所做的一切。

罗玛和公爵们被迅速带出房间。你请求一位幸存的勇士结束你的生命，他们很乐意这么做。当你感到巨大的战斧划过你的脖子时，你的一生在你眼前闪过。烛堡、爱蒙、葛立安、那西凯的矿井、沙洛佛克、你和舍尔的初次相遇、罗玛、龙矛之围、艾瑞尼卡斯、你所有的胜利和失败。你的最后记忆是舍尔，以及当她同意与你团聚在阿斯卡特拉时你是多么幸福。

血腥的滋味并没有平息你的杀戮欲望。你渴望更多。你需要更多！你心想，这就是你，为何要抵抗这种力量？这是你与生俱来的权利！

你走出地下城，进入盗贼迷宫。你轻易地撕裂一堵堵墙壁，闯入公会。他们微不足道的抵抗毫无效果，你愉快地将他们肢解。你的暴行让整个城市的尖叫声此起彼伏，你继续摧毁盗贼公会。你走上街头，朝公爵宫殿前进。那些愚蠢地挡在你路上的人轻易地被你扫清。

@4101 = ~重返博德之门~
@4102 = ~You, Schael, and the rest of your companions board the elvish caravan and begin the journey back to Baldur's Gate. The long journey provides the necessary time and privacy to have some frank, and often difficult, conversations concerning your relationship. Certain aspects, including living and security arrangements, your role in parenting Rohma, and dealing with your celebrity, are left unclear. What is certain is that the love you share for one another has never been stronger, and that you are both fully committed to making the relationship work. 

Your excitement at the thought of returning to Baldur's Gate gradually turns to apprehension as the caravan moves closer to its destination. You were, after all, forced to leave the city under some very dark circumstances, and many wanted to see you executed. Seeing your growing unease, your love tries to reassure you:

"The city and the Council will welcome you, I'm sure of it. You've nothing to worry about."

Her words should comfort you, but they do not. If nothing else, your experiences over these past months have taught you to hope for the best, but to expect the worst. With that thought in mind, you hear the caravan driver make the announcement:

"Wyrm's Crossing! We've reached Wyrm's Crossing!"   

With Schael's hand in yours, you take a deep breath and step out of your wagon. A group of Flaming Fist officers and city officials approach as you stand on the bridge.~
@4103 = ~You, Captain Corwin and the rest of your companions board the elvish caravan and begin the journey back to Baldur's Gate. The long trek affords you much time for some well-deserved rest and relaxation, which you are more than eager to take advantage of. Moreover, you finally have a chance to reflect on all that's happened since you left for Dragonspear many months ago... all of the twists and turns, your triumphs and defeats... perhaps now, things will settle down, and you'll be free to live your life on your terms. 

During one of the caravan's many stops, you visit Captain Corwin's wagon. Unsurprisingly, she is quite energetic and eager to see her family again. In contrast, your initial excitement at the thought of returning to the city has turned into apprehension. The last time you were in Baldur's Gate, you were nearly executed for a crime you did not commit. Seeing your growing unease, the Captain tries to reassure you:

"The city and the Council will welcome you, I'm sure of it. You've nothing to worry about."

Her words should comfort you, but they do not. If nothing else, your experiences over these past months have taught you to hope for the best, but to expect the worst. With that thought in mind, you hear the caravan driver make the announcement:

@4104 = ~The week long festival held by the Dukes in your honor was a spectacle that you'll never forget. Food, drink, song and dance were shared by all, rich and poor alike, and you experienced the wholehearted adoration of the city. In the weeks that followed, you slowly began to embrace your new role as the city's protector — the Defender of Baldur's Gate. Though you miss your days of adventuring, you cannot deny that for the first time in your adult life, you feel a true sense of belonging, as though this city is where you are meant to be...

You recall the trepidation that you felt when you stepped out of the caravan onto Wyrm's Crossing. You were certain at the time that, somehow, fate would intervene for the worse, as it did so many times before. It seems now that you've been able to escape your father's shadow, and that you're finally free to live your life on your terms...

To that end, you continue your friendship with Major Corwin. Though you don't see each other as often as you once did, your bond remains strong. Tonight, you've invited her to dinner at The Three Old Kegs, the very same tavern where the two of you shared a drink before embarking on the Dragonspear campaign...~

To that end, you continue your courtship of Schael Corwin. The love you share for one another has continued to grow. Over these past weeks, you've begun to build a good relationship with her young daughter, Rohma, and you sense that her father is finally warming up to you. It is your intention for them to move in with you to the Ducal Palace, but Schael has expressed some reservations. 

"You've been great with Rohma, but she needs a little more time."

Although you're not living together, the two of you spend a great deal of your free time with one another. Tonight is a date night, and you've decided to take Schael to dinner at The Three Old Kegs, the very same tavern where the two of you shared a drink before embarking on the Dragonspear campaign...~
@4107 = ~前往萨拉都什的征程~
@4108 = ~Your party boards the caravan for the long trek to Saradush. During the journey, your thoughts wander to Rohma and Audamar. They were nearly killed because of who, and what you are. This is a grim reminder that anyone close to you will always be at risk. At least now, the two of them are safe within the Ducal Palace, under the watchful eye of the Flaming Fist. Moreover, with you out of the city, further attempts on your life won't place them, or any others, in danger.

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You awaken startled and in a cold sweat, and your restlessness has woken up Schael. Concerned, she gently caresses your chest, and tries to settle you down.

"More nightmares?"

You explain how they've been plaguing you these past nights. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. 
 
"Whatever happens, we'll face it together."

She lays her head down on your chest, and you begin to slowly run your fingers through her soft, dark hair. After a time you're able to calm down, and the two of you fall asleep in a tender, loving embrace.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has come to a halt. You and Schael get dressed and exit your wagon. The driver says that you've reached your destination, on the outskirts of the forest northwest of Saradush. The remainder of your journey will be on foot. As the party moves toward the forest, your nostrils are assailed by the acrid smoke. With your eyes watering, you look up and see that the sky is covered in a thick, gray haze; the fire giants have been busy.

Moreover, with you out of the city, further attempts on your life won't place them, or any others, in danger.

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You wake startled and in a cold sweat. Since the caravan has stopped for the night, you step outside of your wagon for some fresh air. While outside, you see Schael sitting next to a pond. She stands as you approach, and gestures to you.

"Couldn't sleep either, eh?"

You tell her of the nightmares that've been plaguing you of late. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. She places her hand on your shoulder to reassure you. 

"Whatever happens, we'll face it together."

After some idle chatter, you return to your wagons to get some sleep.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has reached its destination on the outskirts of the forest northwest of Saradush. The remainder of your journey will be on foot. As the party moves toward the forest, your nostrils are assailed by the acrid smoke.

Your mind drifts to Schael. You fondly remember your last romantic evening with her, and you're eager to return to her warm, tender embrace.

When this spell is cast at a creature, it breaches and dispels all of the specific and combat protections on the target creature. Here is a complete list of all the specific protection spells that are dispelled by Breach: Shield, Protection Circle, Resist Fear, Protection From Fire/Cold, Fireshield, Protection From Acid, Protection From Electricity, Protection From Magic Energy, Protection From The Elements, and Protection From Energy. The combat protection spells dispelled by Breach are Protection From Normal Missiles, Protection From Normal Weapons, Protection From Magical Weapons, Stoneskin, Armor, Ghost Armor, Spirit Armor, Absolute Immunity, Mantle, and Improved Mantle.

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen. However, telltale traces—a shimmering—allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.

Note: After making an attack, the wizard is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the wizard.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 11-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 8 ft. of it. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes damaging everyone within a 11-ft. radius. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d6 per level of the caster, or half with a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party lest they set it off accidentally.~

(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The affected creature functions at double its normal movement and attack rates and receives a +2 bonus to its initiative. Thus, a creature moving at 6 and attacking once per round would move at 12 and attack twice per round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not sped up. There are three major differences between the 3rd-level wizard spell Haste and this spell: First, there is no period of fatigue following the expiration of the spell; second, this spell will only affect one creature; third, this spell actually doubles the number of attacks per round of the hasted creature. This spell also negates the effects of a Slow spell, but it is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic. Its effects will last for the duration or until dispelled.~

Level: 7
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it dispels one spell protection of up to 8th level affecting the target creature. Every round thereafter till the duration of the spell expires, another spell protection will be removed from the target. The spells affected by Khelben's Warding Whip are Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, and Spell Shield. This will always remove the highest-level spell protection affecting the target; if more than one same-level protection is active on the target simultaneously, one of them will be randomly chosen and dispelled.

The spell on this page is: Stoneskin
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way. The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.~

The spell on this page is: Pierce Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 6
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast upon a target creature, there will be two major effects: First, the creature's Magic Resistance, if any, will be lowered by 1% per level of the caster; second, one spell protection of 8th level or lower affecting the creature, if any, will be canceled. For example, if this spell were cast by a 15th-level wizard, the target creature would lose 15% of its Magic Resistance from its current total (reducing it to 0 if less than that remains), and one 8th- or lower level spell protection affecting the creature would be dispelled. Spells affected by Pierce Magic are Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Globe of Invulnerability. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. Magic Resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.~

(Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a 2-ft. diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly to its target. The effect the orb has upon the target varies with the level of the caster. Each orb will do damage to the target against which there is no save and an effect against which the target must save vs. Spell with a +6 bonus:
 1st Level: 1d4 damage and blinds the target for 1 round.
 2nd Level: 1d4 damage and inflicts pain (-1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, AC, and THAC0) upon the victim.
 3rd Level: 1d6 damage and burns the victim for an additional 1d8 damage.

Rohma filled the role of a big sister wonderfully, and Audamar was ecstatic to watch his three grandchildren grow up together. 

Though she would always miss <CHARNAME>, she was able to solidify her on-again, off-again relationship with her close friend and lover Neoma, and the two of them eventually married. Imoen, Skie, and many of <CHARNAME>'s old adventuring companions were present to witness the ceremony. Even some old friends from the coalition days attended, including Glint, Voghiln, Mizhena and Thaird, to name a few. The evening after the ceremony, Schael gazed into the night sky and saw a glimmer in the heavens, and at that moment felt an indescribable outpouring of love and happiness... somehow, she knew that it was <CHARNAME> expressing his joy at seeing her marry Neoma.

Schael stayed on with the Flaming Fist, eventually rising to the rank of Colonel before retiring to start her own archery academy. The academy quickly gained renown, and under her instruction and leadership it produced some of the finest sharpshooters that the Sword Coast had ever seen. Schael and her wife proved inseparable, and they lived out their years in peace and contentment. The couple watched with delight as Schael's children, and grandchildren, grew up to become well-regarded leaders in their respective fields. 

The happy family was never troubled by Beno or his associates ever again.~

As time passed, Schael reflected more on her decision and realized that, although she would always miss <CHARNAME>, she did have feelings for Neoma, feelings that went beyond simple physical attraction. She decided to take a chance with Neoma, and to their mutual delight, their romance and love for one another blossomed.

@5029 = ~[The Personal Diary of Sarevok]Diary

14th of Eleint, 1365: Today Cormyr has instituted a ban against the Iron Throne from operating within their borders. While this is a great blow to the Iron Throne, it is the perfect opportunity for Rieltar to approach the Throne high council with his proposal. If things go well, we could begin the operation within the year.

25th of Marpenoth, 1365: Davaeorn has sent a message to Rieltar, informing him that the mine at Cloakwood has been drained and is ready for use. This revelation should help greatly in convincing the Throne high council.

2nd of Nightal, 1365: The Iron Throne council has agreed to support Rieltar's plan. He has been given all the resources he needs, as well as leadership of the project. I have expressed interest to my "father," and he has promised to include me within the operations along the Sword Coast. He mentioned Mother in our conversation: how I wasn't to be unfaithful to him as she had. He made it clear that I would suffer her fate if I was. His threats are weak and hollow, and I shall listen to them for only so long. I have decided to take this time to make my visit to Candlekeep. I have waited a long time to research the prophecies of Alaundo, and I must know if the dreams speak the truth. I will not believe the words of phantoms without proof, and the priest of Bhaal I confronted gave me nothing. He was old and died quickly in my grasp. If the words are true, I shall surely groom stronger acolytes than this.

11th of Ches, 1366: My research has gone well. The monks here at Candlekeep have been quite helpful. From what I have read, it would seem certain that the blood of Bhaal does indeed flow through my veins. His prophecies are (of course) ambiguous, but I think I understand them. He foresaw his coming death, and seeded his essence across the land. The children born as a result bear the marks of chaos, have power with no direction, and shall feel the blood of a god within them. The deaths they bring shall awaken the father, and through them he will rise. It does not explicitly say, but obviously this means that death wrought by the children will cause them to ascend. Fitting, and since the father was the Lord of Murder, proving one's worth must involve an act in accordance with his portfolio. I begin to see what I must do. Death on a god-like scale.

3rd of Tarsakh, 1366: The monk Gorion troubles me. He seems to have taken an interest in my readings. I must be careful to be more clandestine in my research. I wish I could simply kill him, but I doubt I could safely murder him within this damnable library.

11th of Tarsakh, 1366: I had a dream this night. My mother was talking to me, but as she did her face became bloated and discolored. Her voice became weaker as she spoke to me, telling me to save her from Rieltar. I could see the garrote cutting into her neck, but I did nothing. It was only a dream. 

27th of Tarsakh, 1366: I take my leave of Candlekeep now, and not a moment too soon, for I am sure that Gorion has perceived my heritage. One thing that I am certain of: <CHARNAME> is, in actuality, one of Bhaal's brood as well. <CHARNAME> has all the markings, and it would explain Gorion's curiosity in my studies. Though there is nothing I can do now, I will have to make certain to return and kill the little brat. It would be foolish of me to let one of my siblings live, especially one being brought up by the Harpers (and I am sure that is where Gorion's allegiances lie).

5th of Mirtul, 1366: Today I met with Rieltar in Baldur's Gate. The fool still insists on calling me his son, and for now I will let him. He assumes that I am loyal to him because he raised me. Well, loyal I am, but only as long as he is useful. He's set up a base in the mansion of a destitute noble family and says that everything is running smoothly. Mulahey has established himself at the mines of Nashkel, and his kobold minions should be already busily contaminating the iron ore. Only a few slaves have begun to mine out the ore at Cloakwood, though Rieltar assures me that once the bandit raids begin we'll have a steady supply of new slaves.

8th of Hammer, 1367: I met with the leaders of the Chill and Blacktalons. I have little liking for Ardenor, the leader of the Chill, but Taurgosz seems to be a man of his word. It is a good thing, as I'll have to work with these mercenaries for the rest of the year.

3rd of Tarsakh, 1368: Everything proceeds well. The ore coming from Nashkel has started to deteriorate, and my mercenaries have been doing a fine job of destroying any iron caravans on route to Baldur's Gate. Though some of my mercenaries have been captured, most think they work for the Zhents, so no trouble has fallen on the Iron Throne. I am sure that the Zhents at Darkhold won't be pleased to know that their name has been falsely used. I will have to be wary for Zhentish agents in the coming months.

28th of Tarsakh, 1368: I think I now have the time to deal with that old codger Gorion, and his little whelp. I will have to inform my men that I'll be gone for the next few weeks.

? of Mirtul
No time to write, but I must not neglect my journals so. The future dead must know of how the Lord of Murder again came to them. I shall hire a scribe when time allows. Things have not gone completely as I have planned, but I will still be able to salvage the situation. <CHARNAME> is on the move to Baldur's Gate; if I could maneuver the whelp to Candlekeep, then I would have the perfect scapegoat for my plan. My mortal "father," Rieltar, is there to meet with the Knights of the Shield. He has been blocking all my attempts to escalate the hostilities between Amn and Baldur's Gate, and these meetings will only serve to smooth relations. I must rid myself of them all and assume control of the Iron Throne myself. I cannot allow petty business and monetary concerns to interfere. Terribly sorry, "Father," but my true parentage calls and you are in my way. I shall be sure to instruct the doppelgangers in the exact manner Rieltar should die. I think a garrote would be perfect for the task.

12th of Eleasis: The plan to frame <CHARNAME> for the murder of my mortal father has succeeded. My spies informed me that <PRO_HESHE> was apprehended attempting to escape through the catacombs beneath Candlekeep. Angelo has sent a party of Fist enforcers to fetch him and deliver him to me.

26th of Eleasis: Dukes Silvershield and Eltan are dead; Silvershield died at the hands of the assassins Slythe and Krystin, and Eltan finally succumbed to the poison last evening. There are still those within the Fist that are loyal to him, and through they've yet to be rooted out, Angelo should have no difficulty marshaling the Fist for their eventual march upon Amn. I sense that Dukes Belt and Jannath suspect that my role in recent events is greater than what I've let on, but without evidence of wrongdoing they'll be unable to take any action. As for <CHARNAME>, my first official act as Grand Duke will be to preside over <PRO_HISHER> execution, scheduled for tomorrow morning.~
