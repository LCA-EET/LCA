@0 = ~A Taste of What's to Come
Schael and I shared an intimate moment in the storeroom in Dragonspear castle. She assured me that it's only a small taste of what she has planned for me when we finally return to Baldur's Gate.~
@1 = ~Schael Corwin
Words cannot describe the pain and anger that I feel. Schael and I can never be together so long as the city holds me responsible for Skie's death. I must be freed from this cell so that I can find something or someone that can exonerate me, otherwise, I fear I may never see my love again.~
@2 = ~Captain Corwin
Captain Corwin visited my cell this morning. She told me that there are those in the city that believe in my innocence, and that she and others are pleading with the Dukes on my behalf. If they're successful, my life may be spared, though I'll be forced into exile. Exile, however, would afford me the time that I need to find Skie's murderer and prove my innocence. So long as I have friends like her, there is hope.~
@3 = ~科温上尉的教导
科温上尉发现了我握弓姿势上的一些不足。她向我传授了支撑点和施力点的区别，并示范了如何正确利用手掌支撑弓的压力。在她的指点下，我的射击精准度和力量都有了显著提升。~
