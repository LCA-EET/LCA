	SAY BIO						@3090 /* ~When asked about her past, Schael Corwin reluctantly admits she ran wild as a child on the streets of Baldur's Gate. Her rebelliousness soon got her into trouble with the Flaming Fist. 

Left alone in a cell with nothing but her thoughts for company, she began to reflect on the decisions she'd made in the past and see where they would inevitably take her. When she was eventually freed, she decided to change the direction of her life. She enlisted in the Flaming Fist and rose quickly through the ranks.

You sense there is little Schael Corwin would not do for her family or for the Flaming Fist.~*/
