@006=~This is the letter you plan to send to Captain Corwin in Baldur's Gate. You will need to speak to the Athkatla magistrate in order to have it delivered.

My love,

I pray this letter finds you, Rohma and your father well. There is much that I need to tell you. After being forced to depart Baldur’s Gate, our party was set upon by thieves who quickly incapacitated us. We were delivered to Athkatla and held captive in the stronghold of a mad wizard named Irenicus – the very same “Hooded Man” that we encountered during the Dragonspear campaign. My recollection of events from that point is hazy… I do know that we were tortured and experimented upon for purposes that are unclear to me. We were not all fortunate to escape the wizard’s enclave with our lives. The bastard murdered Khalid and Dynaheir. By the time we found their corpses, nothing could be done to resurrect them.

While fleeing the stronghold, I came upon the dagger that is enclosed with this letter. I believe that this is the very same Soultaker Dagger that was used to murder Skie; if I am correct, the city priests can use it to restore Skie’s soul to her body and perform the resurrection. Please take the dagger to the city priests as soon as you are able. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder. 

After our escape, Imoen and Irenicus were abducted by the Cowled Wizards for unsanctioned use of magical power within the city. They were taken to a prison for magic practitioners called Spellhold. I must venture forth to Spellhold, rescue Imoen, and exact my revenge on Irenicus. The mage will pay for what he did to Khalid and Dynaheir, for framing me for Skie’s murder, for my exile from the city, and for keeping us apart. I will see you again, my love, once my innocence is established and this matter with Irenicus is resolved.

Yours always,

@010=~This is the letter you plan to send to Corporal Duncan in Baldur's Gate. You will need to speak to the Athkatla magistrate in order to have it delivered.

Corporal,

I have reason to believe that the dagger included with this letter is the very same Soultaker Dagger that was used to murder Skie Silvershield. If I am correct, the city priests can use it to restore Skie’s soul to her body and perform the resurrection. Please take the dagger to the city priests as soon as you are able. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder. The dagger belongs to a mad wizard named Irenicus. He is the “Hooded Man” that murdered Skie and framed me for the act. Rest assured, he will pay a heavy price for his transgressions against Skie, the city of Baldur’s Gate, my companions, and myself.
  
Please give my regards to Captain Corwin and her father. 

Regards,

@030 = ~At last!

You and Schael, along with the rest of your companions, board the elvish caravan and begin the journey back to Baldur's Gate. The long journey provides the necessary time and privacy to have some frank, and often difficult, conversations concerning your relationship. Certain aspects, including living and security arrangements, your role in parenting Rohma, and dealing with your celebrity, are left unclear. What is certain is that the love you share for one-another has never been stronger, and that you are both fully committed to making the relationship work. 

Your excitement at the thought of returning to Baldur's Gate gradually turns to apprehension as the caravan moves closer to its destination. You were, after all, forced to leave the city under some very dark circumstances, and many wanted to see you executed. Seeing your growing unease, your love tries to reassure you:

"You've nothing to worry about. The city and the Council will welcome you. I'm sure of it."

Her words should comfort you, but they do not. If nothing else, your experiences over these past months have taught you to hope for the best, but to expect the worst. With that thought in mind, the caravan driver makes the announcement:

"We have reached Wyrm's Crossing."  

Holding Schael's hand, you take a deep breath and step out of your wagon. A group of Flaming Fist officers and city officials approach as you stand on the bridge.~ [XA100136]   
@031 = ~The Return to Baldur's Gate~

You, Captain Corwin and the rest of your companions board the elvish caravan and begin the journey back to Baldur's Gate. The long trek affords you much time for some well-deserved rest and relaxation, which you are more than eager to take advantage of. Moreover, you finally have a chance to reflect on all that's happened since you left for Dragonspear many months ago... all of the twists and turns, your triumphs and defeats... perhaps now, things will settle down, and you'll be free to live your life on your terms. 

During one of the caravan's many stops, you visit Captain Corwin's wagon. Unsurprisingly, she is quite energetic and eager to see her family again. In contrast, your initial excitement at the thought of returning to the city has turned into apprehension. The last time you were in Baldur's Gate, you were nearly executed for a crime you did not commit. Seeing your growing unease, the Captain tries to reassure you:

"The city and the Council will welcome you, I'm sure of it. You've nothing to worry about."

You spend much of the remainder of the journey pondering her words. They were meant to comfort you, but they did not. If nothing else, your experiences over these past months have taught you to hope for the best, but to expect the worst. With that thought in mind, the caravan driver makes the announcement:

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You awaken startled and in a cold sweat, and your restlessness has woken up Schael. Concerned, she gently caresses your chest, and tries to settle you down.

"More nightmares?"

You explain how they've been plaguing you these past nights. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. 
 
"Whatever happens, we'll face it together."

She lays her head down on your chest, and you begin to slowly run your fingers through her soft, dark hair. After a time you're able to calm down, and the two of you fall asleep in a tender, loving embrace.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has come to a halt. You and Schael get dressed and exit your wagon.

Hearing a low moan, you turn and see Beno stirring. It seems that, somehow, he is still alive. The sight of his sniveling face is enough to send you past the point of no return. You give into your dark nature, and transform into the Slayer. His pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears, and you rip his heart from his chest. You throw his lifeless body across the room, and begin to eat his still-beating heart.

The taste and gore does little to satiate your bloodlust. You want more. You need more! This is who you are, you think to yourself. Why did you ever resist this kind of power? It's your birthright! 

You make your way out of the Undercity, and into the Thieves' Maze. With ease, you tear through wall after wall, and make it into the Guild. Their feeble attempts to stop you prove fruitless, and you gleefully rip them limb from limb. The screams are heard throughout the city as you continue to decimate the Thieves' Guild. You make your way out into the street and head toward the Ducal Palace. Those foolish enough to remain in your path are easily swept aside.

Upon entering the palace, you are quickly set upon by the Flaming Fist. Even their specially-trained Valiants and Wizards are not enough to stop you. You find the chamber where the Dukes are cowering, and you hear a scream — not from the Dukes, but from someone far more important to you... Rohma. The sight of Schael's daughter crying in terror is enough to snap you out of your murderous reverie. The transformation is undone, and the Dukes look at you, speechless and in horror. You tell Rohma that you are sorry; sorry for not protecting her mother, and sorry for what you have done. 

Rohma and the Dukes are rushed out of the room. You beg one of the surviving Valiants to end your life, and they are happy to oblige. Your life flashes before your eyes as you feel the blade of the mighty halberd slice through your neck. Candlekeep. Imoen and Gorion. The mines of Nashkel. Sarevok. The first time you and Schael met. Rohma. The Siege of Dragonspear. Irenicus. All of your triumphs, and all of your defeats. Your last memory is of Schael, and how happy you were when she agreed to marry you.

Your head hits the floor with a dull thud. The nightmare is over, both for you, and for the city of Baldur's Gate.~ [XA100124]

By the time you read this, you'll have departed the city. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to see you one last time before you left. When Belt, Eltan and Jannath made the decision to exile you, the Fist was put on high alert to prevent Entar and his associates from trying to take matters into their own hands. 

You now have the time you need to find some way to prove your innocence. If you're able to recover the Soultaker dagger, you must send it to me. The wizards believe they can restore Skie, but only if the dagger is in their possession. Once restored, she can corroborate your account of what happened on that night in Dragonspear. You'll be able to return to the city once your innocence is established.   

Good luck to you, my friend.

@100 = ~Legend tells of a couple that was renowned throughout the town for their insatiable greed. One day, a playful goblin who was passing through overheard the townsfolk speak of just how greedy this husband and wife were. Wanting to learn if the rumors of their greed were true, the goblin decided to pay them a visit. 

The goblin appeared to the husband from within a tree trunk, and asked him why he looked so troubled. "Are you ill? Are you hungry? Tired?"

Though frightened by the presence of the goblin, the husband explained that he wasn't sick, tired or hungry. Instead, he told the goblin that he and his wife were poor, and that could not afford all of the fancy clothes, baubles, and other items that they wanted.

"If you are not hungry, cold, or ill, then rejoice because you are not poor!", said the goblin. 

"But I am poor! A man with little or no gold is poor!", explained the husband.

Upon hearing this, the goblin erupted into laughter. He then produced a hen, and explained to the husband that this hen was magical. Every morning, it would produce a golden egg. The goblin offered the hen to the husband, but warned that it would not provide the happiness and contentment that he sought.

The husband quickly took the hen from the goblin and ran home to his wife. Though she didn't believe that the hen was magical, she could at least use the eggs to make a nice omelet, she thought to herself. 

Early the next morning the hen began to cluck, and shortly after, a huge, bright golden egg appeared beneath it! The couple was ecstatic as they held the egg in their hands, but their mood quickly turned sour.

"Well... it seems we'll have to wait until tomorrow for another egg. It will take many weeks before we have enough eggs to be the richest in town. That must be why the goblin laughed when he gave me the hen.", the husband said.

The wife replied, "I've always heard that hens already have all the eggs they will lay inside of them... if this is true, why do we not kill the hen and take all of the eggs at once!" The husband agreed, and without hesitation, the couple killed the poor hen, and opened up her body. To their dismay, they saw that the there were no eggs inside. They then began to weep, for they realized that through their own greed and stupidity, they had lost forever the hen that laid the golden eggs.

@118 = ~I am again in your debt. That creature has kept me helpless for too long.

It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the Harbor Master's building — he is a good friend of mine. I can rest there, and send word to Nederlok and Corwin to return to the city immediately. They're loyalty is beyond reproach, and they can retake control of the Fist while I recover. Take this letter; I managed to filch it off Rashad when he was "caring" for me. From what I read of it, it seems that Sarevok has dire plans for the city. I fear for the lives of my fellow Dukes, Liia and Belt. If they were to die, Sarevok would take over the city. You must find Slythe and Krystin, and stop them... *cough* Hurry! We must make haste.~ 
@119 = ~Oh yeah, lots of stuff. You know about Duke Eltan, don't ya? He's been diseased. That's why Angelo's in charge now.

@120 = ~They still have leadership. How effective it is, I do not know. With Captain Corwin sent on some training exercise up north, I hear Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control. Such a weasel he is. I am surprised he has the support of the troops. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. You've heard of him, right?

It's all Angelo, he's making a power grab, taking control of the Fist and, with Scar gone and Corwin sent on some bogus errand up north, there's nothing to stop him! I've seen him paying visits to the Iron Throne, too, and I don't like it one bit... There are some of us that are still loyal to Eltan and, lucky for you, I happen to be one of them. Please, for your sake and ours, keep your head down and, if you get the chance, sniff around the Iron Throne's base. If you can find a way to talk to Duke Eltan, even better, but they're keeping him in the middle of Fist headquarters... Damn it, Angelo will pay dearly for this and I hope it's soon...~

I freed the genie Malaaq by retrieving a flask from three dryads and giving it to him. In return, he returned some equipment that he was keeping in storage for the wizard Irenicus. The items include a magical weapon that I will undoubtedly make use of, and a dagger that the genie referred to as a prison of souls. Could this be the Soultaker dagger used to murder and imprison Skie Silvershield? If it is, I need to find a way to have it sent to Baldur's Gate as soon as possible.~

She believed, even then, that she was destined for great things. One day, alone in the chapter house library, she attempted to grow her powers by reading from a tome of forbidden knowledge. Instead she unwittingly opened a gate to the realm of the devil Belhifet. Caelar's soul should have been forfeit, but her uncle, Aun Argent, offered himself to the devil prince and was pulled down into the Nine Hells in his niece's place. Caelar never forgot his sacrifice. She vowed that someday, somehow, she would find a way to rescue her uncle from the pit of Avernus... and she was successful, though at great cost.

In spite of the suffering that she'd already endured and her actions in helping <CHARNAME> defeat the Bhaalspawn terrorizing Tethyr, she was sentenced to death by hanging. On hearing this, Aun Argent pleaded with the city leaders to spare his niece. Pressured by Aun, who was seen as a hero by the citizens of Waterdeep, and fearful of an uprising by those still sympathetic to her, the leaders decided to exile her instead. Aun joined her, and the two of them lived a life of seclusion as they helped each other overcome the mental and psychological scars left behind from their experience in Avernus. 

When Aun passed a few years after her exile, Caelar set out on her own and became a wanderer of sorts, righting wrongs and helping people wherever she went. Many believe the Shining Lady is still out there, working steadfastly to atone for her sins.~

Imoen, Skie, and many of their adventuring companions were present to witness the ceremony, as were Flaming Fist officials and local and foreign dignitaries. Included among these were the Grand Dukes, as well as officials from Waterdeep, Daggerford, Amn and Tethyr. Even some old friends from their coalition days attended, including Glint, Voghiln, Mizhena and Thaird, to name a few.

Schael stayed on with the Flaming Fist, eventually rising to the rank of Colonel before retiring to spend more time with her family. After the death of Duke Silvershield, <CHARNAME> was elected as the new Grand Duke, and she helped lead Baldur's Gate to a new era of peace and prosperity. Schael and <CHARNAME> proved inseparable, and they lived out their years in peace and contentment. The couple watched with delight as Rohma, and her children, grew up to become well-regarded leaders in their respective fields.

Though she would always miss <CHARNAME>, she was able to solidify her on-again, off-again relationship with her close friend and lover Neoma, and the two of them eventually married. Imoen, Skie, and many of <CHARNAME>'s old adventuring companions were present to witness the ceremony.

My love,

I pray this letter finds you, Rohma and your father well. There is much that I need to tell you. After being forced to depart Baldur’s Gate, our party was set upon by thieves who quickly incapacitated us. We were delivered to Athkatla and held captive in the stronghold of a mad wizard named Irenicus – the very same “Hooded Man” that we encountered during the Dragonspear campaign. My recollection of events from that point is hazy… I do know that we were tortured and experimented upon for purposes that are unclear to me. We were not all fortunate to escape the wizard’s enclave with our lives. The bastard murdered Khalid and Dynaheir. By the time we found their corpses, nothing could be done to resurrect them.

While fleeing the stronghold, I came upon the Soultaker dagger. To put a long story short, I released Skie's soul, and I believe that the city priests can restore it to her body and perform the resurrection. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder. 

After our escape, Imoen and Irenicus were abducted by the Cowled Wizards for unsanctioned use of magical power within the city. They were taken to a prison for magic practitioners called Spellhold. I must venture forth to Spellhold, rescue Imoen, and exact my revenge on Irenicus. The mage will pay for what he did to Khalid and Dynaheir, for framing me for Skie’s murder, for my exile from the city, and for keeping us apart. I will see you again, my love, once my innocence is established and this matter with Irenicus is resolved.

Yours always,

Corporal,

I'm writing to inform you that I recovered the Soultaker dagger, and that I have performed the necessary steps to release Skie's soul. I believe that the city priests can restore it to her body and perform the resurrection. Once Skie is restored, she will be able to corroborate what I know to be true, that I was not responsible for her murder.

He is the “Hooded Man” that murdered Skie and framed me for the act. Rest assured, he will pay a heavy price for his transgressions against Skie, the city of Baldur’s Gate, my companions, and myself.
  
Please give my regards to Captain Corwin and her father.

@974 = ~The Hen that Laid the Golden Egg~
@975 = ~Legend tells of a couple that was renowned throughout the town for their insatiable greed. One day, a playful goblin who was passing through overheard the townsfolk speak of just how greedy this husband and wife were. Wanting to learn if the rumors of their greed were true, the goblin decided to pay them a visit. 

The goblin appeared to the husband from within a tree trunk, and asked him why he looked so troubled. "Are you ill? Are you hungry? Tired?"

Though frightened by the presence of the goblin, the husband explained that he wasn't sick, tired or hungry. Instead, he told the goblin that he and his wife were poor, and that could not afford all of the fancy clothes, baubles, and other items that they wanted.

"If you are not hungry, cold, or ill, then rejoice because you are not poor!", said the goblin. 

"But I am poor! A man with little or no gold is poor!", explained the husband.

Upon hearing this, the goblin erupted into laughter. He then produced a hen, and explained to the husband that this hen was magical. Every morning, it would produce a golden egg. The goblin offered the hen to the husband, but warned that it would not provide the happiness and contentment that he sought.

The husband quickly took the hen from the goblin and ran home to his wife. Though she didn't believe that the hen was magical, she could at least use the eggs to make a nice omelet, she thought to herself. 

Early the next morning the hen began to cluck, and shortly after, a huge, bright golden egg appeared beneath it! The couple was ecstatic as they held the egg in their hands, but their mood quickly turned sour.

"Well... it seems we'll have to wait until tomorrow for another egg. It will take many weeks before we have enough eggs to be the richest in town. That must be why the goblin laughed when he gave me the hen.", the husband said.

The wife replied, "I've always heard that hens already have all the eggs they will lay inside of them... if this is true, why do we not kill the hen and take all of the eggs at once!" The husband agreed, and without hesitation, the couple killed the poor hen, and opened up her body. To their dismay, they saw that the there were no eggs inside. They then began to weep, for they realized that through their own greed and stupidity, they had lost forever the hen that laid the golden eggs.

Abilities:
- While held in the party's inventory, this hen will produce one golden egg per day.

@1003 = ~I should be safe here. In the mean time, you have quite the task ahead of you. If I'm right, the Iron Throne is going to stage a coup. I fear that Nederlok, Corwin and the others won't return in time.  You're the only ones who'll be able to stop the coup.~ 
@1004 = ~I am again in your debt. That creature has kept me helpless for too long. Perhaps if I hadn't been incapacitated, I might have been able to prevent Scar's death. *cough* Angelo will soon hear of my recovery. It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the Harbor Master's building — he is a good friend of mine. I can rest there, and send word to Nederlok and Corwin to return to the city immediately. They're loyalty is beyond reproach, and they can retake control of the Fist while I recover. Take this letter; I managed to filch it off Rashad when he was "caring" for me. From what I read of it, it seems that Sarevok has dire plans for the city. I fear for the lives of my fellow Dukes, Liia and Belt. If they were to die, Sarevok would take over the city. You must find Slythe and Krystin, and stop them... *cough* Hurry! We must make haste.~ 
@1005 = ~Oh yeah, lots of stuff. You know about Duke Eltan, don't ya? He's been diseased. That's why Angelo's in charge now. It'd have been Scar, but he went out and got assassinated, and that Corwin bitch who arrested me's on some training exercise up north with Marshal Nederlok. Ya, the city's gone downhill over the last week. Too bad, heh heh.~
@1006 = ~They still have leadership. How effective it is, I do not know. With Captain Corwin sent on some training exercise up north, I hear Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control. Such a weasel he is. I am surprised he has the support of the troops. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. You've heard of him, right? With Entar dead, the other Dukes have called an emergency election. Sarevok is the front-runner, and his stand against Amn is very popular. Imagine how much pull he will have if he actually has the Flaming Fist in his back pocket.~
@1007 = ~There's trouble in the Fist, <CHARNAME>, big trouble. Duke Eltan's fallen sick and Scar was killed, supposedly in a simple robbery but I have my doubts... It's all Angelo, he's making a power grab, taking control of the Fist and, with Scar gone and Corwin sent on some bogus errand up north, there's nothing to stop him! I've seen him paying visits to the Iron Throne, too, and I don't like it one bit... There are some of us that are still loyal to Eltan and, lucky for you, I happen to be one of them. Please, for your sake and ours, keep your head down and, if you get the chance, sniff around the Iron Throne's base. If you can find a way to talk to Duke Eltan, even better, but they're keeping him in the middle of Fist headquarters... Damn it, Angelo will pay dearly for this and I hope it's soon...~

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You awaken startled and in a cold sweat, and your restlessness has woken up Schael. Concerned, she gently caresses your chest, and tries to settle you down.

"More nightmares?"

You explain how they've been plaguing you these past nights. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. 
 
"Whatever happens, we'll face it together."

She lays her head down on your chest, and you begin to slowly run your fingers through her soft, dark hair. After a time you're able to calm down, and the two of you fall asleep in a tender, loving embrace.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has come to a halt. You and Schael get dressed and exit your wagon. The driver says that you've reached your destination, on the outskirts of the forest northwest of Saradush. The remainder of your journey will be on foot. As the party moves toward the forest, your nostrils are assailed by the acrid smoke. With your eyes watering, you look up and see that the sky is covered in a thick, gray haze.

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You wake startled and in a cold sweat. Since the caravan has stopped for the night, you step outside of your wagon for some fresh air. While outside, you see Schael sitting next to a pond. She stands as you approach, and gestures to you.

"Couldn't sleep either, eh?"

You tell her of the nightmares that've been plaguing you of late. Though you can't recall the details, you know that in each one, you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision. She places her hand on your shoulder to reassure you. 

"Whatever happens, we'll face it together."

After some idle chatter, you return to your wagons to get some sleep.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has reached its destination on the outskirts of the forest northwest of Saradush. The remainder of your journey will be on foot. As the party moves toward the forest, your nostrils are assailed by the acrid smoke. With your eyes watering, you look up and see that the sky is covered in a thick, gray haze. The fire giants have been busy.

The forest, and the besieged city beyond it, await.~ [XA100134]

Moreover, with you out of the city, further attempts on your life won't place them, or any others, in danger. 

Your mind drifts to Schael. You fondly remember your last romantic evening with her, and you're eager to return to her warm, tender embrace. Though it pains you greatly to be apart from her, you're sure that you made the right decision in leaving her behind to protect the city, and her family. Furthermore, you've made good use of the time alone to steel yourself for what will likely be your most difficult challenge yet.

@3006 = ~The Return to Baldur's Gate~
@3007 = ~At last!

You, Captain Corwin and the rest of your companions board the elvish caravan and begin the journey back to Baldur's Gate. The long trek affords you much time for some well-deserved rest and relaxation, which you are more than eager to take advantage of. Moreover, you finally have a chance to reflect on all that's happened since you left for Dragonspear many months ago... all of the twists and turns, your triumphs and defeats... perhaps now, things will settle down, and you'll be free to live your life on your terms. 

During one of the caravan's many stops, you visit Captain Corwin's wagon. Unsurprisingly, she is quite energetic and eager to see her family again. In contrast, your initial excitement at the thought of returning to the city has turned into apprehension. The last time you were in Baldur's Gate, you were nearly executed for a crime you did not commit. Seeing your growing unease, the Captain tries to reassure you:

"The city and the Council will welcome you, I'm sure of it. You've nothing to worry about."

You spend much of the remainder of the journey pondering her words. They were meant to comfort you, but they did not. If nothing else, your experiences over these past months have taught you to hope for the best, but to expect the worst. With that thought in mind, the caravan driver makes the announcement:

"We have reached Wyrm's Crossing."  

You take a deep breath and step out of the wagon. A group of Flaming Fist officers and city officials approach as you stand on the bridge.~  [XA100135]

Though you miss your days of adventuring, you cannot deny that for the first time in your adult life, you feel a true sense of belonging, as though this city is where you are meant to be...

You recall the trepidation that you felt when you stepped out of the caravan onto Wyrm's Crossing. You were certain at the time that, somehow, fate would intervene for the worse, as it did so many times before. It seems now that you've been able to escape your father's shadow, and that you're finally free to live your life on your terms...

To that end, you continue your friendship with Major Corwin. Though you don't see each other as often as you once did, your bond remains strong. Tonight, you've invited her to dinner at The Three Old Kegs, the very same tavern where the two of you shared a drink before embarking on the Dragonspear campaign...~ [XA100138]

To that end, you continue your courtship of Schael Corwin. The love you share for one another has continued to grow. Over these past weeks, you've begun to build a good relationship with her young daughter, Rohma, and you sense that her father is finally warming up to you. It is your intention for them to move in with you to the Ducal Palace, but Schael has expressed some reservations. 

"You've been great with Rohma, but she needs a little more time."

Although you're not living together, the two of you spend a great deal of your free time with one another. Tonight is a date night, and you've decided to take Schael to dinner at The Three Old Kegs, the very same tavern where the two of you shared a drink before embarking on the Dragonspear campaign...~ [XA100137]
@3012 = ~A Nightmare Made Manifest~
@3013 = ~The battle is over. Rohma was saved, but at the cost of the woman you love. You have no hope of bringing her back. Overcome by grief, you fall to your hands and knees, and scream in agony. Hearing a low moan, you turn and see Beno stirring. It seems that, somehow, he is still alive. The sight of his sniveling face is enough to send you past the point of no return. You give into your dark nature, and transform into the Slayer. His pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears, and you rip his heart from his chest. You throw his lifeless body across the room, and begin to eat his still-beating heart.

The taste and gore does little to satiate your bloodlust. You want more. You need more! This is who you are, you think to yourself. Why did you ever resist this kind of power? It's your birthright! 

You make your way out of the Undercity, and into the Thieves' Maze. With ease, you tear through wall after wall, and make it into the Guild. Their feeble attempts to stop you prove fruitless, and you gleefully rip them limb from limb. The screams are heard throughout the city as you continue to decimate the Thieves' Guild. You make your way out into the street and head toward the Ducal Palace. Those foolish enough to remain in your path are easily swept aside.

Upon entering the palace, you are quickly set upon by the Flaming Fist. Even their specially-trained Valiants and Wizards are not enough to stop you. You find the chamber where the Dukes are cowering, and you hear a scream — not from the Dukes, but from someone far more important to you... Rohma. The sight of Schael's daughter crying in terror is enough to snap you out of your murderous reverie. The transformation is undone, and the Dukes look at you, speechless and in horror. You tell Rohma that you are sorry; sorry for not protecting her mother, and sorry for what you have done. 

Rohma and the Dukes are rushed out of the room. You beg one of the surviving Valiants to end your life, and they are happy to oblige. Your life flashes before your eyes as you feel the blade of the mighty halberd slice through your neck. Candlekeep. Imoen and Gorion. The mines of Nashkel. Sarevok. The first time you and Schael met. Rohma. The Siege of Dragonspear. Irenicus. All of your triumphs, and all of your defeats. Your last memory is of Schael, and how happy you were when she agreed to marry you.

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was a great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command of the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races. However, these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep—its slender, now-broken spires—can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands.

@13238 =  ~History of the Dead Three: "KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE"

In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well. Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after the power Jergal wielded. The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually the trio destroyed one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves.

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest—the Bone Throne.

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant.

"I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin.

"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer.

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, "The Throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position." Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued, "who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened. "After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal.

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed. Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened. "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die—even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him.

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.~

@13251 =  ~History of Shadowdale—The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshall of the Twisted Tower: 

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors. The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home. The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below. The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshall of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days. Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege. With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; however, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun. Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people. Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow. Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around <PRO_HIMHER>, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on <PRO_HIMHER>self and fellow party members. And if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.~

@13259 =  ~History of the North III~
@13260 =  ~History of the North—Recent History of the North: 

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. 

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel—and they'd told the king that he'd be disposed by other orcs. 

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, as Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival." 

For four months, the forty-thousand orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls—never too good to begin with—created losses of their own. 

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn. 

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the extraordinary prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould. 

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness. 

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities. ~

@13262 =  ~History of the Zhentarim~
@13263 =  ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth: 

Much confusion exists in the realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim. The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood. In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled, independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea. It is one of the most evil cities in the realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices. Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yûlash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales. The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale. 

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch). Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership. The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts. Their rulership has spread with the passing years. In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes. Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas. 

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep. Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.~

@13293 =  ~History of Calimshan: 

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air. 

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire. Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinn and efreet started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there. Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old. 

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places—Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr—took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe. 

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change. As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born. It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the realms. Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn. The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere. 

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim. A force that great, they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the realms, and that didn't happen. Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir). 

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land. There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its power over its own area. About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land. Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do. The oldest son of each Pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one. The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago.~

@13358 =  ~History of Sembia~
@13359 =  ~History of Sembia: 

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding. However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves who feared the loss of their entire wood. This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR). This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today). It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven. 

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands. Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them. Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace," and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads. At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation. 

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches. The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court. There, he asked the elders of their Council to approve a road, open to humans, linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown). Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur. The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement. However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request. 

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate. If the road was built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished. The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree. The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves. Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear. 

Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt). Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms. Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now halfblind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared. None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves.~

@13361 =  ~History of the North IV~
@13362 =  ~History of the North—The Elven Exodus:

This era left behind elven strongholds ripe for pillaging by humans and orcs. When elves chose to leave the North and travel to Evermeet, their works quickly disappeared, leaving only places like the Old Road and a ruined port in the High Forest to mark Eaerlann's passing. And yet it was not only the elves who would disappear from their long-held homes; the human nation of Netheril also stood on the brink of history.

Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fill its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states that when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began three thousand years ago and reached its conclusion fifteen hundred years later.

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has there been such an outpouring of orcs. Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught and, with the aid of the treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more.

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar.~
@13363 =  ~Book~
@13364 =  ~History of the North VI~
@13365 =  ~History of the North—The Might of Men: 

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost—until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them. 

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city—this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerûn. With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families. 

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns, the seas swim with Northmen pirates, and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor—and support—pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans. 

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war. 

To the far north, the Ten Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and—most importantly—replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying 17 wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement. ~

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing, hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs with vessels sailing in from the south for merchant's jewelry, metal tools, and the occasionally-available weapon or two. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, or a rocky island beyond it.~

@13400 =  ~History of Waterdeep VI~
@13401 =  ~History of Waterdeep—Age lV, The Return of the Lords: 

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled. 

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets. 

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before—save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast. 

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North. ~

@13403 =  ~History of the North VII~
@13404 =  ~History of the North—1368, Year of the Banner:

As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe. As the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible—as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem—to safety.

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included heavy snow, scarce game and low morale.

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate armor.

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog.

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city.~

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea. Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago. In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara. This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba. These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission. 

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in retum for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia). In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar. It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted. According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves. As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods. People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others. Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center. These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Daleland's territory. 

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands. They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales. 

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations. Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base. This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation. 

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members. In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales. A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale. During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep. More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR). ~

@13435 =  ~History of the Western Heartlands: 

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times, these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked—Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day. 

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land—freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers. ~

@13437 =  ~History of the Dragon Coast~
@13438 =  ~History of the Dragon Coast: 

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin. Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day. 

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall. It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south. And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power. 

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate. The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords. His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast—corruption and treachery. 

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR. Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated.~

@13449 =  ~History of Dambrath~
@13450 =  ~History of Dambrath:

The nation of Dambrath was formed out of a barbarian kingdom almost a half-millennium ago by a powerful alliance of priestesses of Loviatar and the drow from the city of T'lindhet.

In 211 DR, fleeing from the destruction of the homeland by the then-great kingdoms of Unther and Mulhorand, four tribes of barbarians entered Dambrath. They found a coast where the dolphins danced and plains where the grass was long. They roamed from the borders of the Walls of Halruaa as far east as the current borders of Estagund. They soon became known as the Arkaiun, or People of the Wind.

In 545 DR a great warchief, Reinhar, arose to lead the tribes. The halflings of Luiren were quickly enslaved, and several of the coastal cities of Durpar were captured or razed. Estagund fell to his rule, and eventually Reinhar turned his attention to Halruaa.

An army of 40,000 horsemen and a fleet of fifty ships mounted a coordinated attack, and even though Reinhar was able to get beyond the Walls of Halruaa and occupy the cities of Mithel, Galdel, and Zalsuu, their magics proved to be more than a match for the invaders. Reinhar was finally defeated in a great battle at Sulaziir by the archmage Mycontil and his troop of wizards.

Reinhar's son, Reinhar II, took command of the army and set out on a two month overland retreat. He arrived home with a thousand surviving fighting men and no shaman. Reinhar II proved to be as good a ruler in defeat as his father was in war. He consolidated his forces and pulled home almost all of his troops, as he knew that the defeat made them tempting prey for raiders and encroaching monsters. This action allowed for the safe development of his peoples.

By the time the ninth Reinhar was king in 802 DR, the Arkaiuns were fat and lazy. Reinhar IX, or Reinhar the Foolish as he is more commonly known, insisted on expanding his nation to gain more gold to finance his military campaigns. He ordered the mining of many rich lodes of silver and electrum in the Gnollwatch mountains, but before his plans of expansion could begin, the miners encountered the drow of T'lindher. The drow were outraged and began a steady series of raids and attacks on the Arkaiun strongholds. Whole villages were destroyed overnight, and no trace of the invaders could be found.

Reinhar IX committed the foolhardy action of attacking the drow in retaliation. While the Arkaiuns managed to get a force into the drow city, this action only succeeded in uniting the normally chaotic drow. For once, the full power of a drow city was turned against an enemy.

The battle quickly moved back to the surface. Reinhar's raiders were wiped out, leaving Reinhar with only a small portion of his original military. This was not enough for the drow, who demanded total enslavement of the entire surface nation. The Arkaiuns resisted valiantly, and the war went on for three decades at tremendous cost in life to both sides.

Finally, the drow had the Arkaiun forces cornered at Malduir. Almost without hope, the defenders were overjoyed when a group of half-elven pilgrims appeared on the scene. The high priestess, Cathyr Shintar, offered the aid of her clerics to help defend the city, and Reinhar took this to be an omen from the gods. A priestess was placed with almost every company.

Within a tenday, the drow struck. The priestesses did indeed prove to be of great aid, but to the drow. Every priestess turned on the Arkaiuns, and Cathyr herself slew Reinhar. The drow were still weakened by the battle, and only the presence of the priestesses enabled them to win. Cathyr, realizing the unique advantage she possessed, made a deal that even the suspicious drow embraced. Her priestesses would rule the land, and in exchange they would provide access to the surface for the drow, trading weapons, slaves, and supplies.

The drow were delighted with this brazen offer from a surface-dweller. Reinhar had been slain and the insult avenged, and after thirty years of war the drow were not particularly interested in Dambrath. They did insist, however, on taking the best captured males as slaves. Cathyr quickly agreed to this, seeing the males as an obstacle to her own power.

Cathyr ruled for 205 years. She fulfilled her promise to make Dambrath, or "The Nation of Pain," a bastion of evil in the realms. In her time, Cathyr saw the priesthood of Loviatar expand to thousands, and faith in the Beastlords previously worshipped by the Arkaiuns was nearly eradicated. Many of the Arkaiuns were able to escape their new mistresses, and flee to the Swagdar. There they resumed their almost forgotten nomadic life.

The priestesses of Loviatar continued to enjoy good relations with the drow, and some even took mates, creating a race of drow half-elves. These dark half-elves became known as the Crintri, or "noble ones." Most are pristesses of Loviatar, though many are mages as well. They consolidated their power, learning much of the area from the Shebali, or "lower ones," as the Arkaiuns are now called. The capital of Dambrath was established at Cathyr, built after Cathyr's passing and named in her honor. Her death came at the hands of her daughter, Filina, who had grown tired of waiting for her mother to die. Filina ruled for only five years, however, before her own daughter, Cathakay, assumed the throne in the same fashion. Cathakay ruled for fifty-four years, eventually falling in battle against a gold dragon. She died childless, and here niece Melanith assumed the throne.

Melanith faced an increasing population, and unrest among males who longed for a return to their prestige of old. Melanith did not return their previous status, but she did make use of them. Fearing that the great nations of Mulhorand and Unther might rise again, she decided that mundane tasks, such as defense of the kingdom, would be handled by men. She was the first to name a male to the post of warchief. Sadalar, a Crintri, became the queen's consort. His term as warchief was characterized by widespread bribery and corruption. He was, however, responsible for getting many privileges returned to the Arkaiuns. After Melanith's rule, the Shebali were considered second class citizens, rather than slaves.

Though males were granted more power during her rule, Melanith also solidified the split between the sexes. While the rulers of Dambrath had been females for over two centuries, it was more because of competence than gender. Melanith, however, decreed that men could have no authority except over other men. The female-led hierarchy of Loviatar was quick to back this move.

Many of the bravest and best men of the kingdom perished in raids on Estagund, Durpar, the bandit tribes of Veldorn, and against the gnolls that had returned to the Gnollwatch mountains. Some even fought at the side of the drow in their battle with the svirfneblin city of Aventine. The deep gnomes were destroyed, but so were the Shebali. The drow and the Crintri were largely unharmed, and for their aid, the Crintri were rewarded with a number of drow males to breed in to their race. Melanith took a drow male as her consort to replace Sadalar, who had perished in the conflict. The drow, Nym Inthigg, fathered three daughters and a son. It was at this time that Melantih began the isolationist policy that Dambrath still follows today.

Melanith ruled for 156 years, her daughter Ausitil for 125. The current queen of Dambrath, Yenandra, who is known in Dambrath as the "Pirate Queen," is said to have sailed as far south as Zakhara on pillaging raids. Yenandra has been ruling for 71 years, and is beginning to show signs of age. She has three daughters as well, named Luatharyn, Meltruil, and Hasifir. While she does remain extremely popular, especially to the Crintri, the children of leaders in this land are not known to patiently wait their turn.~

@13457 =  ~History of the North—The Spread of Humankind:

The adaptable humans made use of magic they could seize or learn from the Proud Peoples to defeat all enemies, breaking (for a time) the power of giants and orcs. Waterdeep was founded. The last of the pureblood elves died out, a result of continued marriages with humans.

In the far west, men also dwelled—wise, clever primitives called the Ice Hunters. They lived simple lives on the coast since time beyond reckoning, countless generations before Netheril's first founders set foot on the Narrow Sea's western shore. Yet this peaceful folk fell prey to another invasion from the south: crude longships that carried a tall, fair-haired, warlike race who displaced the Ice Hunters from their ancestral lands.

This race, known as the Northmen, spread farms and villages along the coast from the banks of the Winding Water to the gorges of the Mirar. Northmen warriors drove the simple Ice Hunters farther and farther north, forced the goblinkin back into their mountain haunts, and instigated the last Council of Illefarn. Within five hundred years of the Northmen's arrival, Illefarn was no more—its residents had migrated to Evermeet.

From the Coast, Northmen sailed westward, claiming and establishing colonies on the major western islands of Ruathym and Gundarlun, eventually spreading to all the islands in the northern sea. Others migrated northward, past the Spine of the World, and became the truly savage barbarians of Icewind Dale.

In the centuries that followed, Ascalhorn became Hellgate Keep when it fell into the hands of fiends, and Eaerlann collapsed under the attack of a new orc horde. The elves fled southeast, joining with Northmen, Netherese descendants, and dwarves to form what would later be known as the Fallen Kingdom. This realm was short-lived and collapsed under the next orcish invasion—though in dying, it dealt the goblin races a blow from which they have yet to recover.~

@13483 =  ~History of Tethyr~
@13484 =  ~History of Tethyr: 

For the past 1,500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power. When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne. As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne. Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so). 

The established reoccurring cycle was broken ten years ago. The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr. King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr. Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well. Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethyr by royal armies. Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury. These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change. 

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however, it takes treachery as well. In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and an impatient royal heir. Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army. While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile. By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help. 

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates. At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father. A fire set by the elite troops would destroy evidence of treachery; the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government. 

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point. Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire. At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid. 

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family. Once Castle Tethyr began to fall, there was no holding back the mob. In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin. Everything of value—fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, and so on.- was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust. 

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos. In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword. This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding." 

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell. Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived. These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr. 

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted. "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society. The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon. ~

@13497 =  ~History of the Moonsea: 

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes. The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yûlash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar. 

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North—including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands—who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic. In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region. 

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning. Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants. Phlan has fallen and risen again. Yûlash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town. Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks. Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt. 

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea. The greatest cities—Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep—are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips. The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature. In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality. ~

@13513 =  ~History of the Chosen of Mystra~
@13514 =  ~History of the Chosen of Mystra:

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known. One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess's other actions during that period, is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate. The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen. This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission. It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals. Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.)

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable. One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun. Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted. Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate. Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved. To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives.

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Dornal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter. Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to. Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body. Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Dornal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor.

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR). The first of seven daughters, Anastra Syluné, was born the following winter. Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanué Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Erésseae Qilué. These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters.

Dornal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; He had always wanted sons as well as daughters. More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell—in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her.

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power. To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body.

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme. Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess. He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North. Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final 30 years of his life. When Dornal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant. Now known as the Watcher, Dornal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.~

For some rare beings, the coin lands edge on—and these luckless few can forge their own fates, for they have more freedom over their destinies than the powers themselves.~
