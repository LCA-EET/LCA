~At last!

//{ 01
You, Captain Corwin and the rest of your companions board the elvish caravan and begin the journey back to Baldur's Gate. The long trek affords you much time for some well-deserved rest and relaxation, which you are more than eager to take advantage of. Moreover, you finally have a chance to reflect on all that's happened since you left for Dragonspear many months ago... all of the twists and turns, your triumphs and defeats... perhaps now, things will settle down, and you'll be free to live your life on your terms.

"We have reached Wyrm's Crossing."

You take a deep breath and step out of the wagon. A group of Flaming Fist officers and city officials approach as you stand on the bridge.~
