This is a grim reminder that anyone close to you will always be at risk. At least now, Schael's family is safe within the Ducal Palace, under the watchful eye of the Flaming Fist. Moreover, with you out of the city, further attempts on your life won't place them, or any others, in danger.

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you're able to sleep, you suffer some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight's no exception. You wake startled and in a cold sweat. Since the caravan has stopped for the night, you step outside of your wagon for some fresh air. While outside, you see Schael sitting next to a pond. She stands as you approach, and gestures to you.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has reached its destination on the outskirts of the forest northwest of Saradush. The remainder of your journey will be on foot. As the party moves toward the forest, your nostrils are assailed by the acrid smoke. With your eyes watering, you look up and see that the sky is covered in a thick, gray haze. The fire giants have been busy.

The forest, and the besieged city beyond it, await.~
