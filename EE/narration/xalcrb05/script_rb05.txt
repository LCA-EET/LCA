Your party boards the caravan and begins the long trek to Saradush. During the journey, your thoughts wander to Rohma and Audamar. They were nearly killed because of who, and what you are. This is a grim reminder that anyone close to you will always be at risk. At least now, the two of them are safe within the Ducal Palace, under the watchful eye of the Flaming Fist. Moreover, with you out of the city, further attempts on your life won't place them, or any others, in danger.

Your mind drifts to Major Corwin. Though her skill, counsel and friendship have proven invaluable to you, you're sure that you made the right decision in leaving her behind to protect the city, and her family. Furthermore, you've made good use of the time alone to steel yourself for what will likely be your most difficult challenge yet.

Though your wagon is comfortable and well-provisioned, a good night's rest continues to elude you. When you are able to sleep, you experience some truly disturbing nightmares, and tonight is no exception. Startled and in a cold sweat, you wake up from your latest terror. Strangely, though you cannot recall any details, you know that in each nightmare you're forced to make an extremely difficult and painful decision.

It's the next morning, and the caravan has reached its destination on the outskirts of the forest northwest of Saradush. The remainder of your journey will be on foot. As the party moves toward the forest, your nostrils are assailed by the acrid smoke. With your eyes watering, you look up and see that the sky is covered in a thick, gray haze. The fire giants have been busy.

The forest, and the besieged city beyond it, await.~
