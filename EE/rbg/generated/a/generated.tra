@63191 = ~This double-edged long sword gleams white even in the reddest of torchlight. The Dethek runes along its sides name the blade "Harrower," a weapon once wielded by Ariabel, a Waterdhavian Paladin of Lathander who once carried the weapon into combat against the vampire Zerafex and her host of unholy spawn. Ariabel did not survive the contest, but decades later a gang of Tethyrian tomb robbers recovered her sword from the crypt where she fell.

@63201 = ~Gold Digger +1~
@63202 = ~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.
