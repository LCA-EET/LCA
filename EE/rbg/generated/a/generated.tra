@63151 = ~Gold Digger +1~
@63152 = ~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.

The surface of this seven-foot shaft more resembles stone than wood, but in the hands of a skilled wielder it weighs little more than a staff of oak.
