@2 =  ~Your assistance would be welcome Captain. Join me.~
@3 = ~Of course, love.~
@4 = ~Gladly, my friend.~

@6 = ~I need you at my side, now more than ever. Join me.~
@7 = ~<CHARNAME>. What do you need?~
@8 = ~LCCORWIJ~
@9 = ~I need to speak to <CHARNAME>.~
@10 = ~Are you alright? It looked for a moment like you were about to keel over.~
@11 = ~I felt some dizziness... it's nothing, I'll be fine.~
@12 = ~Let's just focus on getting out of here. I'll feel better once I am out of this hole.~
@13 = ~Here, put your arm around my shoulder. I'll help to keep you steady. Just take it easy, <CHARNAME>.~
@14 = ~Here, put your arm around my shoulder. I'll help to keep you steady. Just take it easy, love.~
@15 = ~Right. Let me know if you need anything.~
@16 = ~Gods, what was that <CHARNAME>? You turned into a monster!~
@17 = ~What in the hells did Irenicus do to you?~
@18 = ~I... I don't know Schael. I felt an uncontrollable rage, and I blacked out.~
@19 = ~I turned into what?~
@20 = ~I don't know how else to describe it... <CHARNAME>, it was terrifying. ~
@21 = ~I've never seen anything like that before, and I hope to never again.~
@22 = ~I - I'm sorry that you had to see that. Please, just keep your distance, in case it happens again.~
@23 = ~Love, are you feeling any better? Let me help get you on your feet — we need to keep moving.~
@24 = ~Schael, please stay away, for your own safety.~
@25 = ~Keep back, I think - I think it's happening again!~
@26 = ~Get as far away from me as possible, now!~
@27 = ~What's wrong <CHARNAME>... your lips are moving but I can't hear you speak.. wait.. no... not again... NO!~
@28 = ~My love, you could have killed me. I can't risk... we can't be together if you can't get this under control.~
@29 = ~Schael, if I lose control again and put you or anyone else in danger, kill me. I couldn't bear to know that I'd harmed you.~
@30 = ~I don't know how to control it, or even if I can. Keep your distance, please.~
@31 = ~I know that whatever this is, I'll get it under control. ~
@32 = ~And I couldn't bear to live knowing that I killed the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I love. Let's just hope it doesn't come to that.~
@33 = ~You need me by your side now, more than ever. Don't worry — I'll stay clear if it looks like it's about to happen again.~
@34 = ~Good. We'll get through this together, whatever it takes. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.~
@35 = ~Agreed. Let's go.~
@36 = ~Thank you Schael... let's go.~
@37 = ~Quickly, we had better give these lunatics some direction, or they may turn on us.~
@38 = ~You've got to be kidding me. A deal? With you?~
@39 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm going with you. We've come this far together, and I love you too much to turn back now.~
@40 = ~I love you too, Schael, more than you know. Thank you... for everything.~
@41 = ~I love you too Schael. You need'nt risk yourself any further. Think of your father. Think of Rohma.~
@42 = ~Irenicus needs to be stopped. While he's alive no one is safe, and that includes Rohma. Being at your side, love, is the best way I can protect her, and Baldur's Gate.~
@43 = ~Thank you, my love. (You share a warm embrace, and steel yourself for the battle ahead)~
@44 = ~Schael, I can't ask you to risk yourself any further. Think of your father. Think of Rohma.~
@45 = ~Schael my friend. We have accomplished much together — I've need of your aid once again.~
@46 = ~Captain — your assistance has proven invaluable. I wouldn't be here were it not for your strength and fortitude. Let's put an end to this monster once and for all.~
@47 = ~No, <CHARNAME>. I'm coming with you. Irenicus needs to be stopped. While he's alive no one is safe, and that includes Rohma. Being at your side, my friend, is the best way I can protect her, and Baldur's Gate.~
@48 = ~Thank you Schael... for everything.~
@49 = ~And you shall have it, my friend. Irenicus must be stopped, before he can destroy any more innocent lives.~
@50 = ~I'm with you, <CHARNAME>. Irenicus must be stopped, before he can destroy any more innocent lives.~
@51 = ~No, Madame, <PRO_HESHE> doesn't need anything from this whorehouse.~
@52 = ~(She laughs) Don't look so disappointed, love. When we return to Baldur's Gate I'll be sure to give you the... (she glances down, then back up again) attention... you so clearly need.~
@54 = ~(Back away).~
@55 = ~As do I. Let's go love. We have work to do.~
@56 = ~Well, that was awkward. Let's go.~
@57 = ~<CHARNAME>, we... died? I felt you, pulling me with you to this place. Very well — we stood at each other's side in life and will continue to do so, in death.~
@58 = ~(Kiss her) I look forward to that day.~
@59 = ~(Kiss her) Why wait?~
@60 = ~Mm. As much as I want to, this is hardly the time or place, and duty must come before pleasure. Let's go love. We have work to do.~
@61 = ~Mm, is that an order, hero? (She smiles, and places her arms around your shoulders) Gods know it's been too long already.~
@62 = ~Let's find some place more private, shall we? ~
@63 = ~What did you have in mind?~
@64 = ~The street in mid-day, or perhaps the amphitheater. Gods, what do you think? There are plenty of inns in the city, pick one!~
@65 = ~Come with me love, I know just the place. (You resolve to pay for a room at one of the nearby inns.)~
@66 = ~When I said some place more private, I didn't mean this dump. It's filthy. Let's go to one of the better establishments in the city.~
@67 = ~Right... sorry, love.~
@68 = ~The rats bother you, eh?~
@69 = ~Rats, slavers, thieves, the stench, all of it bothers me. Let's go.~
@70 = ~I already told you, we're not making love in this dump.~ 
@71 = ~You know what? Forget it. I'm not in the mood anymore. Let's go.~

@83 = ~With your help, he will be, my friend. Let's go.~
@84 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you have a moment?~
@85 = ~Of course Schael, what's on your mind?~
@86 = ~Before I left Baldur's Gate, Skie approached me and asked that I give you a message.~
@87 = ~She said that she wanted to thank you for releasing her from the dagger, and to apologize for her father's behaviour. You deserved far better than what happened to you.~
@88 = ~There's no need for her to apologize for her father's actions. She was not the one who tried to have me executed. I do appreciate the gesture, however. ~
@89 = ~Thank you Schael, though I doubt I'd have acted any differently if I were in Entar's shoes. That scoundrel Irenicus made sure that all of the evidence painted me as Skie's murderer.~ 
@90 = ~Entar was completely convinced of your guilt, as were many others.~ 
@91 = ~Indeed. He had much of the city convinced of your guilt.~
@92 = ~But not you. Schael, your belief in my innocence was what kept me going. I want you to know that. I also want you to know that I appreciate dearly your being here. It couldn't have been easy for you to leave Rohma.~
@93 = ~It wasn't. I miss her everyday. But I need to be here, with you. Irenicus must be punished for the crimes he has committed.~
@94 = ~Schael... I... I didn't realize how much I needed you near me, until you were gone. Your being here, now, fills a void in my heart that I didn't know was there. I'd like for us to move past friendship, into a more serious relationship. I... I'm in love with you, Schael.~
@95 = ~<CHARNAME>, I missed you too, dearly... I also want us to be more to eachother than what we are now. My heart broke when I read your letter. I keep thinking that if I'd left with you, you wouldn't have been captured, maybe Khalid and Dynaheir would still be alive, maybe —~
@96 = ~Stop it, Schael. Don't blame yourself. There's nothing that you could have done to stop what happened; Irenicus set his trap perfectly. It's better that you were not with me when we were captured — I shudder to think what Irenicus would've done to you had you been captured as well. ~
@97 = ~Schael, what matters is that we are here, together, now.~
@98 = ~Come here, hero.~
@99 = ~Gladly, my dear.~
@100 = ~My love, do you have a moment?~
@101 = ~Of course dear, what's on your mind?~
@102 = ~But not you. My love, your belief in my innocence was what kept me going. I want you to know that. I also want you to know that I appreciate dearly your being here. It couldn't have been easy for you to leave Rohma.~
@103 = ~It wasn't. I miss her everyday. But I need to be here, with you, dear. Irenicus must be punished for the crimes he has committed.~
@104 = ~He will be. And when this is done, love, we'll go back to Baldur's Gate and start our new life together, with Rohma.~
@105 = ~I've been looking forward to that day... more than you know. Let's go, love.~
@106 =  ~(You share a passionate embrace and kiss)~

@115 = ~~
@117 = ~You're a poor example of a parent.~
@118 = ~You think I don't want to be home with my daughter and father? ~
@119 = ~I'm here to fulfil my duties to <CHARNAME>, the Grand Dukes, and the Flaming Fist. If you knew anything about duty or responsibility, you would understand.~
@120 = ~Why even join the Flaming Fist? You willingly put your daughter at risk of becoming an orphan!~
@121 = ~Well, we don't all grow up in wealthy households. Some of us have to work to support their family, instead of playing dress up as a knight in shining armor.~ 
@122 = ~I beg your pardon?~ 
@123 = ~I think you heard me quite clearly. Let's move out.~ [LCCORB21]

@130 = ~<CHARNAME>. We need to talk.~
@131 = ~What is it, Captain?~
@132 = ~Of course love, what's on your mind?~
@133 = ~The vampire. Hexxat. You allow this beast to travel with us?~
@134 = ~We need her, Schael.~
@135 = ~And what of it?~
@136 = ~You're going to have to make a decision, and soon, or I'll make it for you. I trust that I've made myself clear.~

@137 = ~Your time has come, vampire. Allies, to me! Let's rid ourselves of this beast once and for all! ~
@138 = ~Your time has come, vampire. Draw steel! ~

@139 = ~(You notice Captain Corwin staring into the distance, with sadness in her eyes.)~
@140 = ~(You notice Schael staring into the distance, with sadness in her eyes.)~
@141 = ~Captain? Are you alright?~
@142 = ~My love, are you alright?~
@143 = ~(She snaps to attention)~
@144 = ~(She snaps to attention)~
@145 = ~About your daughter and father. I understand.~
@149 = ~Rohma and your father. I understand.~
@146 = ~Yes... You know, Rohma asks about you.~
@147 = ~Really? I didn't think I'd made much of an impression on her.~
@159 = ~Of course she does. I am the *ahem* hero of Baldur's Gate, after all.~
@148 = ~She loves the teddy you bought for her. It's her favorite toy.~
@150 = ~Oh yes, I remember! I bought it at the general store, not long after I met her for the first time.~
@151 = ~It was a simple gesture.. I didn't think it would mean that much to her.~
@152 = ~That one small act of kindness was more than her father ever did for her.~
@153 = ~She deserves better.~
@154 = ~She does. Listen, Schael — I don't know if I'd be a good step parent for Rohma. What I do know is that I'll do my best.~
@155 = ~She does. Listen, Schael — I'm fully aware of the responsibilities and challenges of being a step parent, and I want you to know that I welcome them.~
@156 = ~I know you will. You step up to challenges instead of running from them. That's one of the reasons that I love you, <CHARNAME>. ~
@157 = ~That one small act of kindness from you is more than her father ever did for her... thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@158 = ~Let's get moving.~
@160 = ~(She rolls her eyes) A little humility from time to time wouldn't hurt. But yes, you did leave quite the impression on her.~
@161 = ~You did.~

@162 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you alright? You have a look of concern about you.~
@163 = ~Yes love, I'm fine. I was just thinking about some of the places and people we've seen...~
@164 = ~Before I was exiled, I remember the city was still struggling with the refugee crisis. Have the Dukes had any success in resettling the refugees?~
@165 = ~Yes, at least those whose homes were not completely destroyed by the crusade. Many still need to be resettled.~
@166 = ~There are plans to settle them just east of the city. Some ankheg nests will need to be cleared, but the city planners think it's a workable solution.~
@167 = ~Yes Schael, I'm fine. I was just thinking about some of the places and people we've seen...~
@168 = ~We met some interesting people during the Dragonspear campaign. Remember that gnome, Glint? The goblin shaman, M'Khlin? The others, as well.~
@169 = ~Hah, how could anyone forget. I miss our colleagues from the coalition as well. Hopefully they are doing well.~
@170 = ~Yes, I hope so too. I have a feeling we'll run into them again, sooner or later.~
@171 = ~That's enough reminiscing, for now. Let's get going, love.~
@172 = ~I've thought from time to time about the terror of what we experienced in Avernus. Do you think about that place?~
@173 = ~I do, too. It's only natural, I suppose. It was a traumatic experience for all of us. I still can hardly believe that we went into one of the Nine Hells and came back alive.~
@174 = ~Yes. I often wonder about Aun, Caelar's uncle. Do you think he is still alive, in Avernus?~
@175 = ~Yes. I often wonder about Caelar, and whether she is still alive, in Avernus.~
@176 = ~Perhaps she is. But it doesn't matter. I don't think we'll need to worry about her ever again. Even if she did manage to escape, I doubt she would try to raise up an army again. She'd do better to lay low and live her days in peace.~
@177 = ~Perhaps he is. I'm grateful for his sacrifice. I can't imagine the heartbreak he felt watching his niece pledge her soul to a demon like Belhifet.~  
@178 = ~I often wonder about Aun, Caelar's uncle. It must be hard for him to readjust to society after being trapped in Avernus for so long.~
@179 = ~Last I heard, he was helping to reunite families separated during the crusade. I'm glad he's still able to do some good, in spite of everything that's happened to him.~
@180 = ~I was thinking about the first time we met. Do you remember, love?~
@181 = ~Of course. It was at Wyrm's Crossing. Scar, rest his soul, introduced us. <CHARNAME>, the intrepid adventurer who had been battling bandits up and down the Sword Coast.~
@182 = ~And Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist, who was investigating the Iron Throne within the city. I remember being captivated by your beauty. I still am.~
@183 = ~I'll take your words over roses, any day.~ [BD54567]
@184 = ~And Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist, who was investigating the Iron Throne within the city. ~
@185 = ~The beginnings of a long and fruitful friendship, one that I hope will last well into the future.~
@186 = ~I hope you're right.~
@187 = ~As do I, my friend.~
@188 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you alright? You've a look of concern about you.~
@189 = ~What's on your mind?~
@190 = ~Anything else you'd like to discuss?~
@191 = ~It's good that at least some progress was made.~
@192 = ~Indeed. I too am grateful.~
@193 = ~I was thinking about the first time we met. Do you remember?~
@194 = ~That's enough reminiscing, for now. Let's get going, Schael.~
@195 = ~(You share a warm embrace)~
@196 = ~You nearly sacrificed my soul to that damned demon.. what was its name? Thrax?~
@197 = ~Thrix the Profane, if I remember correctly. Your soul was never in danger — I'd never let a demon like that outsmart me.~
@198 = ~Still, it was quite a gamble. Next time risk your own damned soul, or better yet, don't play such high stakes games with demons, got it?~

@199 = ~I've gone as far as I can. When you regain your senses, you can find me at the Copper Coronet.~

@200 = ~I'm not comfortable with this at all. When you come to your senses, you can find me at the Copper Coronet.~

@201 = ~I don't believe it! <CHARNAME>, this is Neb, the fugitive who murdered more than two dozen children in Baldur's Gate! Your time has come, monster!~

@202 = ~He's dead...~ 
@203 = ~The worst kind. (You hold her hands in yours) Are you alright, love?~
@204 = ~The worst kind. Are you alright, Schael?~
@205 = ~I will be. What he said about Rohma...~
@206 = ~I wouldn't worry about it. He was just trying to rattle you.~
@207 = ~Whatever his intentions, it doesn't matter now. He's dead, and the world is a better place for it.~
@208 = ~You're right, my love. (She calms down) Let's get going.~
@209 = ~You're right. (She calms down) Let's get going.~ 

@210 = ~(Her hands tremble with anger.)~
@211 = ~What kind of monster could murder one child, let alone dozens?~
@212 = ~~
@213 = ~~
@214 = ~Thank you.~

@215 = ~What does Irenicus gain from a war between the surface elves and the drow? There must be a reason.~

@216 = ~You were with her for a while...~
@217 = ~Listen, Schael. She didn't leave me any choice. I had to in order to maintain our cover.~
@218 = ~It meant nothing to me. You're the one that I love.~
@219 = ~And? I did what I needed to, nothing more.~
@220 = ~It means something to me. I understand though why you had to. Let's just get out of this hole and forget that it ever happened.~
@221 = ~I understand. Let's just get out of this hole and forget that it ever happened.~
@222 = ~I see. And did you enjoy it?~
@223 = ~To be perfectly honest, I did.~
@224 = ~That's none of your concern.~
@225 = ~No, I didn't. I feel nothing toward her but disgust.~
@226 = ~You've changed, love, and not in a good way. I can only hope that you'll be yourself again once we've restored what the wizard stole from you. Let's go.~ 

@227 = ~What'd she want?~
@228 = ~For me to sleep with her.~
@229 = ~Better not to ask. What matters is that she didn't get it.~
@230 = ~Really — how'd you manage to get out of that one?~
@231 = ~I told her you'd kill me for cheating on you.~
@232 = ~Hah! In spite of everything, you haven't lost your sense of humor. Come love, let's get going.~
@233 = ~Hm, I didn't see her as the type to be so easily turned away. Let's go love.~

@234 = ~Mazzy, congratulations on your victory. That was quite the performance.~
@235 = ~Thanks, Mazzy. You're one of the toughest people that I've competed against.~
@236 = ~You both performed well. I'm glad to have such skilled companions at my side.~
@237 = ~Schael, you were amazing.~
@238 = ~You know, I heard you cheering for me, love. It meant a lot.~
@239 = ~(You share a warm embrace) Let me see that trophy.~
@240 = ~(She hands it over.) So, what do you think?~
@241 = ~I think that you'll never cease to amaze me.~
@242 = ~Hah, that much is obvious. What do you think about the *trophy*.~
@243 = ~Hm... (You examine the trophy — it's a figurine of an archer cast in gold, with a plaque beneath that states 'Schael Corwin - Winner - Trademeet Archery Competition'.) Very nice. Your father will be proud.~
@244 = ~Thanks. I think Rohma might appreciate it more... I can't wait to see them again. Let's get going, love.~

@245 = ~You... you monster! What you did to Skie, to Imoen, to <CHARNAME>, and the others... it can never be forgiven. You nearly destroyed my hope of a future with the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I love. Prepare to meet your end, Irenicus!~ 
@246 = ~You... you monster! What you did to Skie, to Imoen, to <CHARNAME>, and the others... it can never be forgiven. Prepare to meet your end, Irenicus!~ 
@247 = ~Irenicus already tried to force us apart, and failed. You'll do no better. Our love is stronger than your evil.~
@248 = ~My love, we... died? I felt you, pulling me with you to this place. Very well — we were together in life and will remain so, in death.~
@249 = ~Excruciating is perhaps a better word.~
@250 = ~I'm sorry. I guess I got a little carried away.~
@251 = ~(She smiles warmly, and places her finger across your lips.)~
@252 = ~Shh, lover. It's time for us to get some rest. Just know that this, and more, is what awaits you when we finally return home. I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@253 = ~I love you too, Schael.~

@365 = ~It's time to head out. Let's go, love.~
@366 = ~You and Schael made love for the first time. You feel revitalized — it was an amazing, extremely passionate experience that the two of you will remember for as long as you live.~
@367 = ~My dear... as much as I want you to make love to me...~
@368 = ~You really need to have those wounds looked at first.~
@369 = ~I really need to have these wounds looked at first.~
@370 = ~This bite... I'm not feeling well *cough* at all.~
@371 = ~I understand, love.~
@372 = ~(Skip X-rated content.)~
@373 = ~(Continue with X-rated content.)~
@374 = ~My love... do you have a moment?~
@375 = ~Of course, dear. What's on your mind?~
@376 = ~Not right now, Schael.~
@377 = ~It's important. You'll want to hear this.~
@378 = ~Like I said, I'm in the middle of something.~
@379 = ~Fine (sigh), forget it.~
@380 = ~I've been reflecting on recent events... and the dangers we face.~
@381 = ~You saved my life, <CHARNAME>. I was finished after Bodhi's bite, but you saved me...~
@382 = ~Would you have expected any less? I love you Schael, more than anything. You know this.~
@383 = ~You're a valuable ally. You'd have done the same for me.~
@384 = ~Yes, of course.. what I mean to say is.. Gods, why is this so hard?~
@385 = ~Let's not let our mission, our duties, get in the way of...~
@386 = ~I want you, <CHARNAME>. I want you to make love to me.~
@387 = ~But, I thought you wanted to wait until we returned home, to Baldur's Gate.~
@388 = ~I agree wholeheartedly. (You smile broadly, and kiss her.)~  
@389 = ~It wasn't that I didn't want to. I do want to. It's just that I've always put my duty ahead of my own desires.~
@390 = ~Let me be perfectly clear. I want you, <CHARNAME>. I want you to make love to me.~
@391 = ~Are you saying what I think you're saying?~
@392 = ~That might be the most romantic thing anyone has ever said.~
@393 = ~Nothing would please me more.~
@394 = ~Hardly. (She smiles) But I appreciate the compliment.~
@395 = ~Let's take this nice and slow. Remember — maintain three points of contact at all times.~
@396 = ~Good advice. Climb many trees, Corwin?~
@397 = ~Good advice. Climb many trees, love?~
@398 = ~No, not really. We practice scaling walls during our training exercises. The principle is the same.~
@399 = ~Good advice. Climb many trees, love? Besides mine, I mean.~
@400 = ~(She gives you a wry smile, and rolls her eyes.)~
@401 = ~That smell, ugh. It reminds me of ... it reminds me of Avernus!~
@402 = ~We survived that, and we'll survive this. Stand ready.~
@403 = ~Right.~
@404 = ~<CHARNAME>, that's enough! I know that they are largely responsible for what has happened to you, but control yourself! Our fight is with Irenicus, not them!~
@405 = ~You're right. Sorry, love, I don't know what came over me.~
@406 = ~You're right. Sorry, Captain, I don't know what came over me.~
@407 = ~Fine. We'll do it your way. Self-righteous fools like the priestess here make me sick.~
@408 = ~Just keep it together, <CHARNAME>. We're so close to victory. Priestess — what do we need to do to gain entry to the palace?~ 
@409 = ~Just keep it together, my love. We're so close to victory. Priestess — what do we need to do to gain entry to the palace?~ 
@410 = ~Have you lost your mind!? How does killing these gnomes help us in the hunt for Irenicus?~
@411 = ~I give the orders here, Captain, not you. Follow them, or step aside!~
@412 = ~You're right, Captain. I'm sorry — I've not been myself since my soul was stolen from me.~
@413 = ~You're right, love. I'm sorry — I've not been myself since my soul was stolen from me.~
@414 = ~You've no idea how much this hurts. Allies, to me!~
@415 = ~My friend, I wish there was some way for me to help you... just keep it together. We'll find a way through this. Goldander — we'll help you.~
@416 = ~My love, I wish there was some way for me to help you... just keep it together. We'll find a way through this. Goldander — we'll help you.~
@417 = ~We need to talk.~
@418 = ~I don't like the way things are going. I didn't come all this way to help you commit acts of evil. If things get any worse, you'll find yourself on your own. Let's go.~
@419 = ~What's on your mind?~
@420 = ~I'm sorry. I won't be party to this any longer. When you clean up your act, you can find me in the Athkatla magistrate.~ 
@421 = ~Don't look so disappointed, love. We'll have plenty of time for those... activities (she smiles)... once we're back home. (She leans in for a kiss.)~
@422 = ~Hahah, wait... you *are* joking, right?~
@423 = ~Thanks, but (she nods in your direction) <PRO_HESHE>'s got me covered.~
@424 = ~I'm here on duty, not to pick up men... and certainly not to spend my evening with a drunkard.~
@425 = ~Girl, where are your parents? Do they know that you're out here turning tricks?~
@426 = ~Really, <CHARNAME>? Very funny. (She punches you in the shoulder.)~
@427 = ~Ow!~
@428 = ~Well, she's even better than you, so yes.~
@429 = ~She doesn't compare to you, love. No one does.~
@430 = ~(A fleeting smile graces her face.) Let's just get out of this hole and forget that it ever happened.~ 
@431 = ~(She becomes visibly upset.) You bastard! Gods damnit... (She calms down.)~
@432 = ~(She places her hand on your shoulder.)~
@433 = ~For just having my soul ripped out of me, yes, I feel fine.~
@434 = ~I'm not sure. It's hard for me to explain.... I feel... hollow?~
@435 = ~Whatever he did, we'll find a way to restore you and your sister.~
@436 = ~Right. Let's go.~
@437 = ~Right — and you? Are you alright Schael?~
@438 = ~Yes, I - I'm fine... I'm just disappointed that he escaped.~
@439 = ~You look concerned. What he said about using you to assassinate the Grand Dukes — it'll never happen.~
@440 = ~That's for damn sure. Come on — let's go.~
@441 = ~It's very simple. You're trading slaves, and we're going to shut you down. Do me a favor and resist. Please.~
@442 = ~To think I even considered the possibility of you and I being together. Madness. Be with Dorn, then. I want nothing more to do with you.~ [BD54533] 
@443 = ~H-huh? No, I'm not interested.~
@444 = ~As a matter of fact, I am.~
@445 = ~(You share a warm embrace, and steel yourself for the battle ahead.)~
@446 = ~The bastard is finally dead. The Council will be pleased. I know I am.~
@447 = ~And your soul, my love — are you feeling any differently?~
@448 = ~And your soul, <CHARNAME> — are you feeling any differently?~
@449 = ~They're as dead as your soul, slaver scum. Hand over Claire, now!~
@450 = ~Now's not the time for petty bickering. If we don't work together, none of us are making it out of here alive. Goldander — you said you knew of someone who could help us get into the city?~
@451 = ~*Cough* *Cough*~ [LCA00006]
@452 = ~Love conquers all.~ [LCCORJ04]
@453 = ~I'm not well.~ [LCCORJ05]
@454 = ~Ugh...~ [LCA00007]
@455 = ~I'm not done yet!~ [LCCORJ07]
@456 = ~*Cough* *Cough*~ [LCCORJ08]
@457 = ~I can't *cough* carry that.~ [LCCORJ09]
@458 = ~What was that? (She gives him a dirty look.)~
@459 = ~It's good to see you too, Imoen. As for why I'm here, <CHARNAME> found evidence proving that Irenicus was behind what happened to Skie. I was assigned to assist <PRO_HIMHER> in the hunt for the wizard.~
@460 = ~She's alive and well, thanks to <CHARNAME>. I'll fill you in on the details later. We need to get moving.~
@461 = ~Aye Drizzt, I recognize that insignia on her armor. Yer far from home, aren't ye girl?~
@462 = ~She must be some kind of imposter. The Flaming Fist puts bandits to the sword — they don't fight alongside them!~
@463 = ~He's right, Drizzt. We can't be allowin' these bandits to run free... knows what horrid acts they've committed upon others?~
@464 = ~That's enough, all of you. You (he points at Corwin) — who are you, and what is your business here?~
@465 = ~I am Captain Schael Corwin of the Flaming Fist. I'm travelling with <CHARNAME> on a special assignment to apprehend a wizard, Jon Irenicus.~
@466 = ~How do I know you aren't an impostor, as my friend suggests? I know a bit of the Flaming Fist and its reporting structure. Tell me, who are your commanding officers? Answer carefully.~
@467 = ~Marshall Nederlok, and Duke Eltan.~
@468 = ~I know of another in the Flaming Fist. Based on your claimed rank, you should be reporting to them.~
@469 = ~If you're referring to Scar, he was assassinated several months ago, as part of a plot to usurp control over the city. <CHARNAME> brought both the assassin and the usurper to justice. Scar was a good friend, and I miss him dearly.~
@470 = ~You say you were a friend to Scar. If you were truly his friend, you would know his real name.~
@471 = ~His name was Harold Loggerson.~
@472 = ~(His expression changes from one of suspicion to one of surprise.) Very well. Lower your weapons, friends. She is telling us the truth.~
@473 = ~Scar was a good man. I'm sorry to hear that he has passed. You said you were after a wizard? What has this person done to warrant the attention of the Flaming Fist?~
@474 = ~Yes. The wizard nearly murdered Skie Silvershield, the daughter of one of the Grand Dukes, and framed <CHARNAME> for the crime. <CHARNAME> found evidence proving <PRO_HISHER> innocence and is responsible for Skie's restoration.~
@475 = ~Once <PRO_HISHER>'s innocence was established, I was assigned to them to assist in the hunt for the wizard.~
@476 = ~I ... see. If <CHARNAME> was framed for that crime by the wizard then... perhaps... it may also be the case that it was not <PRO_HESHE> that attacked me while I was beset by gnolls...~
@477 = ~You don't seriously believe them, do you?~
@478 = ~I do. I sense no deception from this woman, and her account of <CHARNAME>'s actions lead me to believe that <PRO_HESHE> is a force for good, not evil.~  
@479 = ~Hold your tongue, drow. I've never known <CHARNAME> to resort to banditry. I suggest that you and your companions move along — now.~
@480 = ~Eh? Is she threatening us? Do you think she's serious?~
@481 = ~If you are in need of assistance, I'll be glad to offer it. If not, I will wish you well and we shall be on our way back to the far north.~
@482 = ~I'm in need of nothing at the moment. Farewell.~
@483 = ~I have a proposal for you, Drizzt, if you'll wait for a moment.~
@484 = ~We seek to defeat a vampire in Athkatla too powerful to face alone. Will you help?~
@485 = ~<CHARNAME> — a word?~
@486 = ~Yes, Captain. What is it?~
@487 = ~Yes, love. What is it?~
@488 = ~That adventurer we encountered, Drizzt, was adamant that you had assaulted him. Was he speaking the truth?~ [LCCORJ11]
@489 = ~I'd rather not talk about it.~
@490 = ~No, you know me, I'd never do such a thing.~
@491 = ~Yes, I did. I regret it, and I promise you that I'm not the same person that I was.~
@492 = ~Yes, I did, and I'd do it again. I was struggling to survive and needed his equipment.~
@493 = ~I see. Let's go.~
@494 = ~I appreciate your honesty. We've all made bad decisions — it's good though that you've learned from yours. Let's go.~
@495 = ~I appreciate your honesty. We've all made bad decisions — it's good though that you've learned from yours. Let's go, love.~
@496 = ~Sometimes I feel like I don't know you at all. I'd rather you'd have done it and been honest with me than to lie about it. Let's go.~
@497 = ~Yes, I did. I saw he was a drow, and everything I'd heard about his kind convinced me that he'd harm me after killing the gnolls.~
@498 = ~I appreciate your honesty. Let's go.~
@499 = ~I appreciate your honesty. Let's go, love.~
@500 = ~It's good to see you again, Captain, but I'm surprised that you're here.~
@501 = ~Skie, is she ...~
@502 = ~Good. Right, let's get moving.~

@503 = ~I've heard enough.~
@504 = ~(Captain Corwin walks up to Lady Delcia and delivers a powerful, open-handed slap to her face that sends her crashing to the floor. Delcia looks up at Corwin, and is left quivering and speechless.)~
@505 = ~Now, listen to me. I didn't leave my family and travel all this way only to be spoken down to by a pretentious, insufferable bitch. We aren't your servants, and you're no better than the dirt on my heel. Get up.~ 
@506 = ~Now get the hells out of here!~
@507 = ~I've heard enough. Forgive me, Nalia.~
@508 = ~(She stands in shock.)~
@509 = ~(She leaves in a hurry, with her hand covering the bruise on her face.)~
@510 = ~The de'Arnise keep has been invaded

Nalia's aunt, Lady Delcia, has been rescued. She has gone to leave the keep on her own, after Captain Corwin smacked some sense into her. The fact that she has left is... ah... something of a blessing.~
@511 = ~(Remain silent.)~
@512 = ~Are you deaf, woman? Get out!~
@513 = ~Gods. I think she needed that as much as I did.~
@514 = ~It was for her own good. Anyone who runs their mouth like that to the wrong person risks an untimely death. Hopefully she learned her lesson.~
@515 = ~I can't believe you did that, love.~
@516 = ~I can't believe you did that, Corwin.~
@517 = ~She definitely deserved it. Well done, love.~
@518 = ~She definitely deserved it. Well done, Captain.~
@519 = ~Well said — let's get moving.~
@520 = ~My love, you seem... Is everything alright?~
@521 = ~I've just been so stressed lately... I wouldn't normally do something like that.~
@522 = ~I know it's tough being away from your family. I'm glad you're here though. (You share a warm embrace, and kiss.) Let's get moving, love.~
@523 = ~You and I both... my love, I know of a couple of activities that can help us to relieve some of that stress...~
@524 = ~(She smiles.) I think I know what you have in mind.~  
@525 = ~Let's finish up here. Afterward, I want you to find a nice place for the two of us to ... relieve some of our stress.~
@526 = ~I know just the place. (You resolve to pay for a room at one of the nearby inns.)~
@527 = ~What do you suggest?~
@528 = ~Good. (She gives you a kiss on the cheek.) Let's go.~
@529 = ~I've been watching you, love, and of late I don't like what I see.~ [LCA00008]
@530 = ~What? I don't understand.~
@531 = ~For all of your power, your fighting skills are suspect. You're not bad with a weapon, but your hand-to-hand skills are sorely lacking. I shouldn't be surprised based on your upbringing in Candlekeep, but I'm concerned.~
@532 = ~You're speaking to the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who defeated Sarevok and stopped Caelar's crusade. You're clearly mistaken, love.~
@533 = ~Perhaps you're right. I'm open to any tips you can give me.~
@534 = ~You defeated them with raw power, not skill. Get us a room and I'll show you what I mean. Let's go.~
@535 = ~Very well. Get us a room and I'll show you what I mean. Let's go.~
@536 = ~You can be beaten by a seemingly lesser opponent if they recognize and exploit your lack of skill.~
@537 = ~Gods, I've been looking forward to this all day. Help me get this armor off, lover.~
@538 = ~Brevlik, your advocate will be with your shortly. <CHARNAME> — we better head back to the Hall of Wonders.~
@539 = ~Mm. Before we get started. About what we discussed —~
@541 = ~And you, young lady.~
@542 = ~(He looks at Corwin, and the Flaming Fist insignia on her armor.)~
@543 = ~I trust you are here to effect some appropriate punishment for what I did to Skie Silvershield?~
@544 = ~Ugh...~
@545 = ~(She struggles mightily against her restraints.)~
@546 = ~You won't get away with this, wizard!~
@547 = ~Worry not, my dear. Unlike the others, you will live past these next few minutes. Once I am done with <CHARNAME>, you'll soon be returned home, where you will assassinate the Council of Four on my behalf.~
@548 = ~What..? No, never!~
@549 = ~It's a trivial matter. You'll be enslaved just as easily as Yoshimo was. Enjoy your last moments of autonomy, child.~
@550 = ~It's a trivial matter. You'll be enslaved through the use of a geas. Enjoy your last moments of autonomy, child.~
@551 = ~Let.. me.. GO!~
@552 = ~Release us! I will kill you, I swear it!~
@553 = ~The Hall of Wonders...~
@554 = ~<CHARNAME>, did I ever tell you how I got arrested?~
@555 = ~You, arrested?~
@556 = ~No, I don't think you did, Captain.~
@557 = ~No love, I don't think you did.~
@558 = ~Well... it was after my mother died. My father was still a Fist at the time, so when he left for work I'd leave the house to hang out with some ... friends of mine. It's how I met Beno.~
@559 = ~We got ourselves into a *lot* of trouble.~
@560 = ~Well? Tell me more.~
@561 = ~Hah, some things never change. You still get into a lot of trouble, only with me instead!~
@562 = ~One day, we had the brilliant idea to go to the Hall of Wonders and play hot potato with a jeweled egg. It was donated to the museum by an emissary from Tethyr. It must have been worth hundreds, or even thousands of gold.~
@563 = ~There we were, throwing this very expensive and precious egg around, while the museum guards were frantically chasing us in and around the Hall.~
@564 = ~Guess who was holding the egg when the music stopped?~
@565 = ~You.~
@566 = ~That's right. I was arrested... and my 'friends' all ran away. It's a good thing that the egg wasn't damaged, otherwise I might still be in prison, hah.~
@567 = ~My father could've gotten me out like he did so many times before, but this time, he didn't — and I'm glad. Spending that night in that cold cell was a major wake up call for me.~
@568 = ~I know what you mean. I never want to see those cells again.~
@569 = ~Do you ever think of how your life would have changed had you not been arrested?~
@570 = ~I do... Would Rohma be here? Would I have joined the Fist? Taken part in the Dragonspear campaign?~
@571 = ~... Would I be in love with the most amazing and heroic <PRO_MANWOMAN> in Faerûn?~
@572 = ~Only the Gods know. Come on, let's head in. I'm sure they've set up some interesting new exhibits since the last time we were here.~ 
@573 = ~You know, sometimes I think how my life would've changed if I hadn't been arrested that day...~
@574 = ~Would Rohma be here? Would I have joined the Fist? Taken part in the Dragonspear campaign?~
@575 = ~And would I be in love with such an incredible, beautiful and determined woman?~
@576 = ~(You share a warm embrace.)~
@577 = ~Come on, let's head in. I'm sure they've set up some interesting new exhibits since the last time we were here.~ 
@578 = ~Only the Gods know, I guess...~
@579 = ~Fine. But you and I are going to have a long talk about this.~
@580 = ~(She turns, and looks at you with disappointment.)~
@581 = ~You — gnome! Get out of here before I change my mind!~
@582 = ~(She delivers a swift, powerful kick to his behind.)~
@583 = ~(Keep quiet.)~
@601 = ~Schael shared a number of submission and other hand-to-hand techniques with you to improve your effectiveness in combat. You also gained some valuable insight into who's really in charge, at least when it comes to bedroom 'activities'.~
@602 = ~(You end up making love again before finally falling asleep.)~

@604 = ~What manner of creature is imprisoned here?~  
@605 = ~Bastard! You lied to us! You knew it was Demogorgon that was imprisoned the entire time!~
@606 = ~Justice has finally come for you, wizard. Prepare to die!~ 
@607 = ~<CHARNAME>! Oh, thank goodness... 
 
(You notice tears forming in her eyes.)~ [LCCORJ12]
@608 = ~S-Schael...? How long was I...?~ 
@609 = ~Two days... *sob* ... h-how are you feeling?~
@610 = ~Good, just ... tired. A-are you crying? What happened?~
@611 = ~Nothing, it's just... (her voice cracks) I thought I'd *sob* lost you...~
@612 = ~Come here, love. 
(She lays her head down on your chest, and you hold her tenderly in your arms.)~  
@613 = ~(She finally loses her composure and begins to weep in earnest.)~
@614 = ~It's alright Schael, let it out. I'm here.
 
(You gently caress her head as you feel her warm tears touch your skin.)~  
@615 = ~(She lifts her head up, and wipes the tears from her eyes and face.)~
@616 = ~Get some rest love. I'll check in on you later.

(She plants a kiss on your forehead.)~ 
@617 = ~Thank you Schael. For everything.~
@618 = ~Please, stay with me.
 
(You reach out and take hold of her hand.)~
@115 = ~Gladly, my dear. [LCCORJ13]

(You slide over so there is enough room on the bed for the two of you. When she climbs in, you kiss and rest in eachother's embrace.)~ 
@619 = ~That was one hell of a party.~ [LCCORJ14]
@620 = ~It definitely was.~ 
@621 = ~A better liquor selection would have been nice...~
@622 = ~I think it'll pale in comparison to the one the city will throw for us upon our return. (She smiles.)~
@623 = ~Baldur's Gate? Are they expecting us?~
@624 = ~They are. While you were recovering, I asked the elves to send word to the Council that Irenicus was dead, and that we'd be returning to the city soon. Gods, I can't wait to see Rohma and my father.~
@625 = ~We can head back home as soon as you are ready, love. The elves were gracious enough to arrange a caravan for us. Before we go, I suggest that you first check with the team to see who'll be coming with us. I imagine some'll want to stay here and help the elves with their wounded.~
@626 = ~Excellent! Let's head out.~
@627 = ~Right. I'll speak with them and get back to you.~
@628 = ~Aerie — will you be joining us?~
@629 = ~Before we go, let's check with the rest of the team to see if they want to come with us. I imagine some'll want to stay here and help the elves with their wounded.~
@630 = ~My love — are you ready to head back to Baldur's Gate?~ [LCCORJ15]
@631 = ~Are you ready to head back to Baldur's Gate?~ [LCCORJ15]
@632 = ~Let's go.~
@633 = ~Not yet.~
@634 = ~Take your time. Come and see me when you're ready.~
@635 = ~I'm almost there, Rohma. I'll be home soon...~ [BD54570]
@636 = ~You can count me in. Oh, I can't wait to see Liia again! There are so many stories I'll share with her.~
@637 = ~This is where we part ways, at least for now, <CHARNAME>. Gorion would be proud of the <PRO_MANWOMAN> you've become. I'll remain here to help undo the damage that Irenicus inflicted on the Tree of Life.~
@638 = ~(You share a warm embrace.)~
@639 = ~I'll be joining you, my dear.~
@640 = ~This is where we part ways, at least for now, <CHARNAME>. I urge you to become the type of <PRO_MANWOMAN> that Gorion would be proud of. I'll remain here to help undo the damage that Irenicus inflicted on the Tree of Life.~
@641 = ~I'll join you. The sooner we can leave, the better — the surface elves are looking for an excuse to murder me, I know it.~
@642 = ~Oh, yes, this is a wonderful opportunity to expand my turnip business! I'll go with you.~
@643 = ~Back to Athkatla for me, I'm afraid. The turnips need tending to. Safe travels, my friends.~
@644 = ~We're in a city of magical knowledge that few humans have set foot in, and you want me to go back to that diseased backwater of a city? Bah! I'll remain here and learn the secrets of the elves. (That is, until they throw me out.)~
@645 = ~I would go with you, but Boo has become intensely infatuated with a squirrel that he saw on the Tree of Life. I must find this squirrel and determine if she is a worthy mate for Boo.~
@646 = ~(She points at Hexxat.) She will not be joining us. I'll not allow the monster to feed on the citizens I'm sworn to protect.~
@647 = ~Oh, of course I will go with you! M-maybe we can also see Candlekeep? It'll be fun to see where you g-grew up.~
@648 = ~O-oh, I think it'll be better for me to stay here. There are still many injured, and the elves can use my help.~
@649 = ~T-thank you, <CHARNAME> for everything. For freeing me from the circus, and for taking me on this grand adventure. I've learned so much about the world, and.. and about m-myself. I h-hope to see you again soon.~
@650 = ~(You share a warm embrace.)~
@651 = ~This is an opportunity to understand the plight of the poor from a broader perspective. I'll go with you. ~
@652 = ~I will remain here for a time, my sparrow. I wish to see this place restored to its former beauty. May our paths cross again in the near future.~
@653 = ~Aye, I'll go with ye. It hath been many a year since I travelled the Sword Coast, plus I be sick of these queers already. I'll stop at Beregost on the way and pay an old friend of mine a visit.~
@654 = ~I promised my wife that I would return home after putting an end to Irenicus, and I will do so. Good-bye, my friend. May Torm guide your path.~
@655 = ~Now that Irenicus has been dealt with, I must return to my order and my duty. Good-bye, my friend. May Torm guide your path.~
@656 = ~I sense that my patron wishes for us to part ways, at least for now. I have a feeling that our paths will cross again, and soon. Until then, <CHARNAME>.~
@657 = ~Yes, I'll go with you. Anywhere, even Baldur's Gate, is better than staying here.~
@658 = ~There is nothing left for me in Amn. Captain, I'd like to take you up on your offer and join the Flaming Fist, at least on an interim basis.~
@659 = ~Excellent — you'll make a fine addition to the team.~
@660 = ~No, I won't be joining you. I'm going back to my cabin in the woods. I'll use the time and seclusion to decide what to do with my life.~
@661 = ~Of course I'll join you silly! It'll be nice to see the Sword Coast again!~
@662 = ~I'm afraid I too must return to the order. Safe travels <CHARNAME>, and you as well Captain.~
@663 = ~I'm afraid I must decline, and return to my order. Safe travels <CHARNAME>, and you as well Captain.~
@664 = ~I will join you. There is little left for me in Amn, and I am eager for a fresh start.~
@665 = ~I will remain by your side my love, now and always.~
@666 = ~I will remain here for a time and help the elves repair the damage to the Tree of Life. Good-bye and safe travels, friends.~
@667 = ~I will remain here for a time and help the elves repair the damage to the Tree of Life, then, I will return home to raise my son. Good-bye and safe travels, friends.~
@668 = ~Yes my friend, I will return with you. I am interested to see what progress has been made in dealing with the refugee crisis. My help may still be needed.~
@669 = ~Are you ready to leave?~
@670 = ~The elves were also gracious enough to provide us a caravan for the trip back. Are you ready to leave, love?~
@671 = ~The elves were also gracious enough to provide us a caravan for the trip back. Are you ready to leave?~
@672 = ~Take a few minutes to gather your belongings. When you are ready to leave, come and talk to me.~
@673 = ~Sir, it's been so long since I've seen my family. I'd like to spend some time with them before we get started.~
@674 = ~Thank you, sir.~
@675 = ~Yes, sir.~
@676 = ~Corporal, I trust all is well with you? How is Skie?~
@677 = ~Changed? In what way?~
@678 = ~Understood. <CHARNAME>, let's head in. We'll stop at my place first. It's in the southeast part of the city.~
@679 = ~No — I still need to see my family.~
@680 = ~<CHARNAME> — I really need to see my family. My home's in the southeast part of the city. Let's go.~
@681 = ~(They share a long embrace, and Schael gives her daughter a big kiss.)~
@682 = ~Mommy! Grandpa, mommy's home!~
@683 = ~Oh, I've missed you so much!~
@684 = ~I missed you too mommy!~
@685 = ~Schael, I'm glad you're home.~
@686 = ~Me too, father.~
@687 = ~(They share a warm embrace.)~
@688 = ~I see you've brought company.~
@689 = ~If you arrest him, you'll have to arrest me too, Captain. Let him go.~
@690 = ~As am I, sir.~
@691 = ~Corporal Duncan told us you'd be home soon. I can't tell you how much of a relief it is to have you back.~
@692 = ~Fine. But only because I love you.~
@693 = ~Gods, where does the time go?~
@694 = ~Gods, where does the time go?~
@695 = ~Oh! Look what I got for you Rohma.~
@696 = ~(She hands her the trophy she won at the Trademeet Archery Competition.)~
@697 = ~Can you read me what it says?~
@698 = ~Winner.. eighth an-annu...~
@699 = ~Annual. Remember, sound it out one part at a time.~
@700 = ~Annual... trade..meet... ar..chery.. c-comp.. comp-e-ti-tion!~
@701 = ~Great job honey. Your reading has improved quite a bit.~
@702 = ~Mommy and <CHARNAME> have some business to attend to before tomorrow morning, when we meet with the Dukes.~ 
@703 = ~The individual responsible has been arrested.~
@704 = ~I'm coming back here as soon as we're done. Give me a kiss, sweetie.~
@705 = ~(Rohma gives her mom a hug and a kiss.)~
@706 = ~I love you mommy.~
@707 = ~I love you too, Rohma. Father, I'll see you later.~
@708 = ~Right. Take care of what you need to. We'll be here when you get back.~
@709 = ~<CHARNAME>, Duncan is waiting outside. Let's inform him that we're ready to see the Dukes.~
@710 = ~Sir, allow me to introduce you to Valygar. He's a ranger from Amn who has expressed interest in joining the Flaming Fist. I know that he'd make a great addition to our team.~
@711 = ~Yes, sir.~
@712 = ~Rohma!~
@713 = ~(You think to yourself that this is the first time you'll have met Schael's family. It may be worthwhile stopping at one of the General Stores in the city to see if you can find a gift for her daughter.)~
@714 = ~What do you say, Rohma?~
@715 = ~(You think to yourself that it's been a while since you've seen Schael's family. It may be worthwhile stopping at one of the General Stores and getting a gift for her daughter.)~
@716 = ~(They share a warm hug.)~
@717 = ~I heard you'd be coming home! How are you?~
@718 = ~(They break into laughter.)~
@719 = ~Listen, I have to start my shift soon. Let's get caught up later, over a drink or two.~
@720 = ~See you later, Captain.~
@721 = ~(They speak amongst themselves for a time. You can't make out what they are saying.)~
@722 = ~Really? You and ... (she looks at you and smiles.)~
@723 = ~I'm just glad to be home. How're things with you?~		
@724 = ~Sounds good. I'll see you later.~
@725 = ~(They hug, and Neoma leaves after giving Schael a kiss on her cheek.)~
@726 = ~Oh, Neoma...~
@727 = ~I think so but.. refresh my memory.~
@728 = ~You two seem very... ah, friendly.~
@729 = ~Neoma and I are friends. Sometimes a little more than that. But you're the one I love, <CHARNAME>. Not her.~
@730 = ~She was posted to Beregost at the height of the bandit raids.~
@731 = ~Oh, right. She paid 50 gold for each filthy bandit scalp. The money was a big help at the time.~
@732 = ~Doesn't that pose a conflict for you? I mean, you're her superior.~
@733 = ~I'm higher than her in rank, yes, but she doesn't report to me either directly or indirectly.~
@734 = ~Right. I remember her staying in the tavern while I did all of the work.~
@735 = ~I missed her dearly...~
@736 = ~You two seem very... ah, friendly.~
@737 = ~I'm glad you were able to see her again, love. Let's go.~
@738 = ~Heh, is that so...~
@739 = ~Neoma and I are friends. Sometimes a little more than that, if you know what I mean. But you're the one I love, <CHARNAME>, not her.~
@740 = ~Is my... friendship with Neoma going to be a problem? If so, I'll stop seeing her. I don't want anything to jeopardize the love that you and I have for oneanother.~
@741 = ~I don't know, Schael. I've never been in any kind of long term relationship, before meeting you. It's hard for me to know what's healthy for a relationship and what isn't.~
@742 = ~It's not a problem, so long as you don't develop any serious feelings for her.~
@743 = ~Problem? No — in fact, I'm... ah... intrigued by some of the ... possibilities.~
@744 = ~I understand. Thank you for being honest about your feelings, love. I'll tell Neoma that from now on, we're to be friends and nothing more. Let's go.~
@745 = ~I... see.~
@746 = ~And I won't. Thank you for being honest about your feelings, love. Let's go.~
@747 = ~(A mischievous smile graces her face.)~
@748 = ~Somehow, I knew you'd be. I'll see if she's interested. Let's go.~
@749 = ~Little girl, what's your name? You said you were sent here from Baldur's Gate? ~
@750 = ~Do you know who it was who sent you here?~
@751 = ~Here, take this gold.~
@752 = ~Tina, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here, then head to the Government District. Speak to Inspector Brega, and tell him everything that happened. Go, now!~ 
@753 = ~I hope those kids can make it to safety.~
@754 = ~They will, don't worry.~
@755 = ~So do I.~
@756 = ~Everytime the Fist thinks that the slaver problem is under control, we find out how wrong we are.~
@757 = ~I'll launch an investigation as soon as I return to the city... someone needs to make those slaver bastards pay!~
@758 = ~Sir, before you leave — while we were in Athkatla, we found evidence of slaver activity occurring in Baldur's Gate.~
@759 = ~We encountered a large number of refugees from Caelar's crusade. They told us that they were shipped out of Baldur's Gate to Athkatla.~
@760 = ~They were told that they were being moved to new homes in other cities. Instead, when they arrived in Athkatla, the children were separated from their parents and sold to slavers. We weren't able to find the parents, though we did free the children from their captors.~
@761 = ~I'd like to investigate and see if I can find who's responsible for shipping them to the slavers.~
@762 = ~Thank you, Marshal Nederlok.~
@763 = ~Thank you — before you leave, while in Athkatla I found some evidence of slaver activity occurring in Baldur's Gate.~
@764 = ~Corporal, I need to see my family first. It will only take a moment.~
@765 = ~Mommy and <CHARNAME> need to go see the Dukes and tell them about what happened in Amn.~ 
@766 = ~Listen, honey.~
@767 = ~And so am I. Thank you, both.~
@768 = ~Will my daugher understand why I need to be away from home so much?~
@769 = ~(She turns to you.)~
@770 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm going to spend the rest of the day with my family. Take some time for yourself — I'm sure you have a lot of faces that you want to see. I'll see you tomorrow morning at the debriefing.~
@771 = ~My love, I'm going to spend the rest of the day here, with my family. Why don't you take some time for yourself? I'm sure there are a lot of people and places that you want to see.~
@772 = ~Just another minute, <CHARNAME>.~
@773 = ~(She turns back to her daughter.)~ 
@774 = ~Take your time, love.~
@775 = ~Take your time, Captain.~
@776 = ~Mommy loves <CHARNAME>, mommy loves <CHARNAME>, mommy loves —~
@777 = ~Rohma! That's enough!~
@778 = ~So, where're you planning to stay tonight?~
@779 = ~The Three Old Kegs.~
@780 = ~Good. Come here.~
@781 = ~(You share a warm embrace and kiss.)~
@782 = ~You definitely deserve some quality time with them.~
@783 = ~I was hoping to spend the night here, with you.~
@784 = ~The Three Old Kegs.~
@785 = ~And I want you to, but first, Rohma's going to need some time to adjust to us being together.~
@786 = ~I'll stay at the Three Old Kegs tonight.~
@787 = ~Enjoy — you earned it.~
@788 = ~Sounds good. You certainly have a lot of catching up to do.~
@789 = ~I'll stay at the Blade and Stars tonight.~
@790 = ~I'll stay at the Elfsong Tavern tonight.~
@791 = ~I'll stay at the Blushing Mermaid tonight.~
@792 = ~So, what'll it be?~
@793 = ~I understand.~
@794 = ~Rohma, honey - ~
@795 = ~I'm sorry, she's not normally this excited.~ [LCCORJ26]
@796 = ~Hahah, no need to apologize.~
@797 = ~She's just glad to see her mommy again.~
@798 = ~Sweetie, come and say bye to <CHARNAME>.~
@799 = ~(She whispers in your ear.) I'll come see you in your room tonight, lover.~
@800 = ~It has. Listen, this isn't social visit. We're investigating reports of slaver activity in these docks, specifically, allegations that children are being shipped from here and sold into slavery. What do you know about these activities?~
@801 = ~Shipped from Baldur's Gate, you say? No, I don't know anything about it. We do periodic inspections of cargo on behalf of the city authorities, but we haven't come across any children.~
@802 = ~Now, wait a minute... A couple months back, there was a program started by some upstart noble to resettle refugees. He claimed to have connections in other cities that he used to find families willing to host them.~
@803 = ~He chartered a number of ships from this dock to places like Athkatla, Calimport, Waterdeep, and others.~
@804 = ~What's his name? Where's he now?~
@805 = ~I don't remember his name, but I know he and his company've set up shop in the old Iron Throne headquarters.~
@806 = ~Give me all of the shipping manifests for his company since the start of the refugee crisis, until now.~ [LCCORJ25]
@807 = ~I need some more time for those manifests. Give me an hour, I should have 'em ready for you by then.~
@808 = ~Not in an hour, now. Unless you want the Flaming Fist to turn these docks inside out.~
@809 = ~Right... one moment.~
@810 = ~Here they are. The shipping manifests for Winston Ventures for the period you mentioned.~
@811 = ~Thank you for your cooperation. ~
@812 = ~Hmm.. <CHARNAME>, look. The manifests identify the company as Winston Ventures, but the contents are encoded.~
@813 = ~We should pay a visit to the Thieves' Guild. They may know how to decode them.~
@814 = ~Right. Let's go.~
@815 = ~That's better. You'd be well served to keep your tongue on a short leash.~
@817 = ~Good. I better not that hear that foolishness from you again.~
@818 = ~Good. That's what I thought.~
@819 = ~I see. Come with me to the Flaming Fist headquarters. I'm sure Duke Eltan would appreciate hearing how much of a fool he is for allowing <CHARNAME> back into the city.~
@820 = ~Is that so? Duke Entar would love to hear more of your wisdom, citizen. Come with me. Now.~
@821 = ~Mind your tone, citizen! In disparaging <CHARNAME>, you disrespect the Council who has exonerated <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@822 = ~The Dukes have proclaimed <CHARNAME>'s innocence. Do you mean to imply that they're mistaken?~
@823 = ~I received the shipping manifests from the harbor master, but they are encoded and I cannot decipher them. Captain Corwin recommended visiting the Thieves' Guild to see if they can help decode the manifests.~
@824 = ~It's good to be back, sir. How have the Fist and the city fared in my absence?~
@825 = ~Both are doing well, thankfully. We've gained some promising new recruits, and the refugee crisis has been brought under control. Between the Iron Crisis, Sarevok, Caelar, and the situation with <CHARNAME> and Skie, it's been a rough couple of years. It's good that things've finally settled down.~
@826 = ~Have the townspeople given you or <CHARNAME> any problems?~
@827 = ~Most've been accepting, even welcoming. There were just a few loudmouths, but they've been straightened out.~
@828 = ~That's good to hear. Before I forget — Duke Eltan's tied up with some unrelated business, but he wanted me to tell you that he's glad that you and <CHARNAME> are back, and that he'll see you at the debriefing.~
@829 = ~Thank you sir. I'll leave you to your work.~ [LCA00009]
@830 = ~Duke Eltan is tied up with some unrelated business. He wanted you to know that he's glad that you and <CHARNAME> have returned, and that he'll see the two of you at the debriefing.~
@831 = ~Most've welcomed our hero with open arms. (She smiles at you.)~
@832 = ~Very good, Captain. I'll see you at the debriefing.~
@833 = ~Let's pay this Winston Ventures company a visit. We might be able to find a way to decode the manifests.~
@834 = ~I received the shipping manifests from the harbor master, but they are encoded and I cannot decipher them. Captain Corwin suggested that we head to the old Iron Throne tower, now the headquarters of the company we're investigating, to see if we could find a way to decode the manifests.~
@835 = ~We're here on Flaming Fist business. Let us through.~
@836 = ~Tina Bennett — <CHARNAME>, that's the name of the child that we rescued in Athkatla.~
@837 = ~That's right — Kerrachus, do you know anything else that might help?~
@838 = ~My love... that name, Tianna — haven't you mentioned her to me before?~
@839 = ~Yes... Tianna and I were seeing eachother for a time. A very short time.~
@840 = ~I see... What happened? I mean, why'd you two break up?~
@841 = ~Tianna... is a user. She takes advantage of people, and their trust. The last straw was when she stole money from my family.~
@842 = ~It wasn't much. If she'd just asked me, I'd have given it to her. She thought she'd got away with it, but Rohma saw her.~
@843 = ~When she told me what Tianna did, Tianna called Rohma a liar. Like a five year old could even think to lie about something like that.~ [LCCORJ23]
@844 = ~You made the right decision.~
@845 = ~I just wish I'd seen what she was earlier. ~ [LCCORJ22]
@846 = ~That's not someone I'd want around my child.~
@847 = ~It worked out in the end. You found someone better.~
@848 = ~(You share a warm embrace and kiss).~
@849 = ~Let's go, love.~
@850 = ~Much, much better. (She smiles.)~
@851 = ~Come here.~
@852 = ~No, that won't be necessary.~
@853 = ~We're here on behalf of Tianna.~
@854 = ~I hope you learned something from this Tianna. Next time, you might not be so lucky.~
@855 = ~That's a good decision. Take care of yourself, Tianna.~
@856 = ~(They share an embrace.)~
@857 = ~You too, Schael.~
@858 = ~I've been doing a lot of thinking and... I don't think this city is a good fit for me. I'm going to take my mom south to Beregost, and try for a fresh start over there.~
@859 = ~Is Tianna working?~ 
@860 = ~No, that won't be necessary.~
@861 = ~(You hear her muttering under her breath.)~ [NOSOUND]
@862 = ~Tianna... (sigh)~
@863 = ~Fine — we'll help you. <CHARNAME> and I'll talk to Jasper about forgiving your debt.~
@864 = ~We're working on it.~
@865 = ~Makes sense. Thanks for the help.~
@866 = ~Thanks for the help.~
@867 = ~Nothing, at least for now.~
@868 = ~My love — I imagine you have some people and places around the city that you want to see. Do you want me to come with you?~
@869 = ~Of course, but just for a couple of hours. You and your family deserve to spend some time with eachother.~
@870 = ~I'd rather you stay here and enjoy some quality time with your family. You've earned it.~
@871 = ~Very well.~ 
@872 = ~Rohma, father — <CHARNAME> and I have some business to attend to. I'll be back in a couple of hours.~
@873 = ~I love you mommy.~
@874 = ~I love you too, Rohma. Give mama a hug.~ [LCCORJ21]
@875 = ~(They share a warm embrace.)~
@876 = ~I'll see you soon, sweetie.~
@877 = ~Good. Don't take too long. Rohma, say bye to mommy.~
@878 = ~I love you too honey. I'll be back soon, I promise.~
@879 = ~Oh, Rohma... I hope so. It's a big committment.~
@880 = ~You know how mommy has a duty to the Flaming Fist? Well, I also have a duty to you and grandpa. A committment is like a duty.~
@881 = ~It's a big duty for anyone, sweetie, but it's very rewarding at the same time.~
@882 = ~What's a com-it-mint?~
@883 = ~So being a daddy is a big duty for <CHARNAME>?~
@884 = ~Let's talk about this some more, later.~
@885 = ~Yes. We need to talk about this.~
@886 = ~Tell <CHARNAME> he can play with my dolly if he'll be my daddy.~
@887 = ~I will, honey. I'm sure he'd appreciate that. We'll talk some more about this when I come back.~
@888 = ~Be a good girl while I'm gone.~
@889 = ~I will, mommy.~
@890 = ~Thanks, father. How were things while I was away?~
@891 = ~Quiet, thankfully. I've been teaching Rohma some basic addition and subtraction. She's picks things up fast, like you did at her age.~
@892 = ~I'm not surprised. She has a great teacher.~ [LCCORJ20]
@893 = ~Hardly. Your mother, rest her soul, was much better than I am.~
@894 = ~Listen, Schael. I know you have strong feelings for <CHARNAME>.~
@895 = ~Someone of <PRO_HISHER> notoriety being around Rohma has me worried, though.~
@896 = ~What do you mean? <PRO_HESHE> would never hurt her.~
@897 = ~No, of course not. What I mean is that someone might use Rohma, or you for that matter, to get to <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@898 = ~<CHARNAME> and I discussed this on the way here... it might get complicated at times, but we're both committed to finding a way to make our relationship work. What's more, <PRO_HESHE>'s a good <PRO_MANWOMAN> father — I trust <PRO_HIMHER> with my life.~
@899 = ~It's good that you've had those discussions... You know, I can't remember the last time I saw you so happy and full of energy. <CHARNAME> must really love you.~
@900 = ~I know <PRO_HESHE> does father. And I love <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@901 = ~I'm glad. Well, you better get a move on then. I'll see you later.~
@902 = ~Right. I'll be back soon.~ 
@903 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm going home to spend the rest of the day with my family. I'll see you tomorrow morning at the debriefing.~
@904 = ~My love, I'm going home to spend the rest of the day with my family. Have you decided where you're staying tonight?~
@905 = ~I was hoping to spend the night at your place.~
@906 = ~I'm looking forward to it...~
@907 = ~You'll do more than just see me, I hope.~
@908 = ~(She laughs). Much more. See you later.~
@909 = ~(She gives you a distasteful look.)~ 
@910 = ~Skie, listen to me — put the dagger down, slowly.~ [LCCORJ19]
@911 = ~Put that damned dagger away Skie. It's gotten me into enough trouble already!~ 
@912 = ~Do as she says, Skie.~
@913 = ~<CHARNAME>... the caves beneath Dragonspear, remember? We encountered a rift into the Fugue plane. Hephernaan's acolytes were performing some sort of ritual there.~
@914 = ~Catatonia? But... we were told she'd made a full recovery.~
@915 = ~Very good. This is exactly what we need to prove Winston's guilt. <CHARNAME>, let's take this to Marshal Nederlok.~
@916 = ~It's a nice night. Let's take a walk.~
@917 = ~At this hour? What do you have in mind?~
@918 = ~You'll see. Afterwards, I'll walk you home. Let's go, love.~
@919 = ~So, love. How's life in the Ducal palace?~
@920 = ~Mm. That was delicious.~ [LCCORJ34]
@921 = ~It was. You ready for another drink?~
@922 = ~No, thanks. Two was enough. Work in the morning, you know?~
@923 = ~So, love. Tell me — how's life in the Ducal palace?~
@924 = ~Good... It'l be better though once the three of you move in.~
@925 = ~I don't doubt it. You've been great with Rohma... She's adjusted well to our being together, I think.~
@926 = ~I'm just about settled in.~
@927 = ~Right.~
@928 = ~My steak was a little overdone, but overall the meal was great.~
@929 = ~Just about? It's been a month since you moved in. How long does it take?~
@930 = ~Well Schael... it's a bit lonely, to be honest. It won't feel like home until the three of you move in.~
@931 = ~Would that I could say the same about your father.~
@932 = ~Oh, don't mind him. He's that way to everyone, though he's warming up to you.~
@933 = ~You think so?~
@934 = ~I do. He told me that he liked the speech that you gave at the Hall of Wonders the other day. The one about your experiences in Amn.~
@935 = ~Oh, really? I'm glad. ~
@936 = ~It's getting late, love. I should head home.~
@937 = ~Speaking of work, how's Valygar? I heard he took Marshal Nederlok up on his offer to join the Flaming Fist.~
@938 = ~He's doing well. He got his first arrest a few days ago. Breaking and entering.~
@939 = ~I'm glad to hear it.~  
@940 = ~I'll walk you home.~
@941 = ~(She smiles.) A hero, and a gentleman. Let's go.~ 
@942 = ~(She smiles.) Let's go.~ 
@943 = ~So, my friend. Tell me — how's life in the Ducal palace?~
@944 = ~Just about. It's a big adjustment from what we're used to.~
@945 = ~I'm just about settled in... it's just a big difference than what I'm used to.~
@946 = ~Are you and Anomen settled in?~
@947 = ~Are you and Aerie settled in?~
@948 = ~Are you and Jaheira settled in?~
@949 = ~Are you and Neera settled in?~
@950 = ~I don't doubt it.~
@951 = ~It's getting late. I should get going.~
@952 = ~And you, Schael? How are you and Rohma adjusting to being together again?~
@953 = ~It's been great... speaking of... look at the time. I should get going.~ 
@954 = ~The stars are beautiful tonight... ~ [LCCORJ32]
@72 = ~And look at the reflection of the moonlight on the river...~ [LCCORJ33]
@955 = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@956 = ~I was just remembering when we first met.~
@957 = ~It is beautiful... but its beauty pales in comparison to your own, Schael.~
@958 = ~I remember... it's only been what, a little over a year? At the same time... I feel like we've known eachother for much, much longer.~
@959 = ~I feel the same way. We've been through so much together. Schael, I...~
@960 = ~What is it, love?~ [LCCORJ31]
@961 = ~(Get down on one knee, and present her with the engagement ring.)~
@962 = ~Sweet of you to say. You're not too hard on the eyes yourself, dear.~
@963 = ~(As she turns to you, her face is illuminated by the soft, pale moonlight. She has never looked more strikingly beautiful to you, and you're momentarily taken aback.)~ [NOSOUND]

@965 = ~Schael, my love. Will you marry me?~ 
@966 = ~(Take her hand, and place the ring on her finger.)~
@967 = ~Do you like it?~
@968 = ~I love it... it's perfect. And I love you. More than you'll ever know.~
@969 = ~Yes! Yes of course I will!~
@970 = ~(You stand, and you quickly pull eachother into a long and very passionate embrace.)~
@971 = ~Hold out your hand, love. (Place the ring onto her finger.)~
@972 = ~I love you too, Schael.~
@973 = ~I know it's late, but come home with me. I want to tell Rohma the good news!~
@974 = ~Of course, my dear. Let's go.~
@975 = ~Father!~ [LCCORJ29]
@976 = ~...uhnnn... S-Schael...~
@977 = ~What happened! Where's Rohma!?~ [LCA00010]
@978 = ~They t-took her... said they w-would trade her for.. ...~
@979 = ~For what? Who took her?~
@980 = ~For ... <CHARNAME> ... it was B-Beno and.. a woman..~
@981 = ~W-what? I don't understand.~
@982 = ~...letter..~
@983 = ~(He rolls to his side. A letter is nailed into his shoulder blade.)~
@984 = ~Oh, Gods! <CHARNAME>, I can't pull the spike or he'll bleed out!~
@985 = ~Huh? The front door is open.~ [LCCORJ42]
@986 = ~Were you expecting guests?~
@987 = ~No.. it looks like it was broken into..~
@988 = ~Oh, Gods! Rohma! Father!~
@989 = ~(She runs inside, and you follow in after her.)~
@990 = ~(Audamar lies on the floor, bloodied and severely beaten.)~
@991 = ~Beno...~ [BD52113]
@992 = ~(She quivers, then screams in rage.)~
@993 = ~Schael! We'll get Rohma back, just try and calm down — Audamar, they said they'd trade Rohma for me. Did they tell you where they'd make the exchange?~
@994 = ~WILL I NEVER BE RID OF HIM!? UGH!!~
@995 = ~Stay with your father. I'll get help. Hang in there, Audamar!~
@996 = ~Major, your father is going to be fine. I believe he'll make a full recovery.~
@997 = ~Oh, thank goodness.~
@998 = ~Let us now discuss the matter at hand...~
@999 = ~Kent — read for us again the letter recovered from Audamar.~
@1000 = ~Yes sir. It reads as follows:~
@1001 = ~"<CHARNAME>, son of Bhaal. Illasera of the Five requests your presence in the Undercity, in the temple of the father. You and Major Corwin are to come, alone. If anyone else follows you, the child will die. 

Do not keep us waiting for long."~
@1002 = ~"<CHARNAME>, daughter of Bhaal. Illasera of the Five requests your presence in the Undercity, in the temple of the father. You and Major Corwin are to come, alone. If anyone else follows you, the child will die. 

Do not keep us waiting for long."~
@1003 = ~The Five... I've heard rumors of a such a group causing havoc in the vicinity of Saradush.~
@1004 = ~Saradush? But that's so far away. What I wonder are they doing here, and what do they want with <CHARNAME>?~
@1005 = ~What they want with me is irrelevant. We have to get Rohma back.~
@1006 = ~Indeed. Major, you mentioned that you know one of the captors, yes? Beno Famari, is it?~
@1007 = ~Yes. He's Rohma's father, as distasteful as it sounds.~
@1008 = ~We're wasting time... I need to get her back!~
@1009 = ~You'll almost certainly be walking into a trap. It'd be better to send some additional support, perhaps a platoon of Valiants —~
@1010 = ~No! Forgive me sir, but you saw the letter. I can't risk my daughter being harmed.~
@1011 = ~That bodes well for your daughter, then. I doubt that he'd wish to see her harmed.~
@1012 = ~That said, it's all but certain you'll be walking into a trap. It'd be better to send some additional men, perhaps a platoon of —~
@1013 = ~Schael is right. We need to go after them, alone.~
@1014 = ~I'll go after them, alone.~
@1015 = ~I can't let you do that!~
@1016 = ~Schael, I want you by my side, but not if you're emotionally compromised. The risk to Rohma would be too great.~
@1017 = ~Schael, if you're to come with me, I need you calm, cool and collected — for Rohma's sake. Can I count on you?~
@1018 = ~What?! No.. you're right... I'm letting my feelings get the better of me. I need to focus. For Rohma.~
@1019 = ~(She takes a deep breath, and settles down.)~
@1020 = ~I'm ready, <CHARNAME>. You can count on me, I promise you.~
@1021 = ~Good. Let's go get Rohma.~
@1022 = ~<CHARNAME>... this ring...~
@1023 = ~You've enough money that you don't need to work ever again.~
@1024 = ~That's your money. Consider it compensation for everything you've had to endure.~
@1025 = ~It's as much yours, Schael, as it is mine... I wouldn't be here were it not for your efforts in securing my release.~
@1026 = ~Even if it were my money, I'd probably keep working, at least for a while longer. Rohma needs to understand the value of hard work.~
@1027 = ~Besides, I haven't given up on making colonel one day.~ 
@1028 = ~Nor should you. Colonel Corwin... I think I like the sound of that.~
@1029 = ~What did the healers say? Is my father going to make it?~
@1030 = ~(She begins to slowly breathe in and out. You recognize this as the breathing exercise that Rasaad taught her in Amn.)~ 
@1031 = ~My love, I want you by my side, but not if you're emotionally compromised. The risk to Rohma would be too great.~
@1032 = ~If you're to come with me, I need you calm, cool and collected — for Rohma's sake. Can I count on you, love?~
@1033 = ~What are we waiting for, then!? Let's go!~
@1034 = ~(She smiles.)~
@1035 = ~Colonel? Seems a bit bureaucratic to me.~ 
@1036 = ~You think so?~
@1037 = ~You've always struck me as more of a 'hands-on' type of person.~
@1038 = ~Maybe... but being so close to the action for so long has a tendency to shorten one's lifespan...~
@1039 = ~I've think you've shown that you can handle whatever comes your way, Schael.~
@1040 = ~Sitting in an office all day? You'll get bored.~
@1041 = ~I know we'd be walking into a trap... but Rohma's in danger! We have to go and get her!~
@1042 = ~You're right. We haven't a moment to spare. Let's go.~
@1043 = ~Yes, and we will. They won't harm her, so long as she's useful to them in making the exchange.~
@1044 = ~I'll rouse the Dukes right away — they may have insight into this 'Illasera'. Let's discuss the matter in the Ducal palace before we make our move.~
@1045 = ~So what are we to do in the meantime? I can't just sit here while Rohma's being held captive!~
@1046 = ~Tell me about Beno. Do you think he has it in him to harm his own daughter?~
@1047 = ~He's threatened my father and me for years, but never Rohma...~
@1048 = ~That's good... we may be able to use that to our advantage.~
@1049 = ~Fine. But whatever we decide, we need to do it quickly. I'll go after her myself if I have to.~
@1050 = ~You mean to turn Beno against Illasera? It won't work. Beno's only ever cared for himself.~
@1051 = ~Still, it may be worth trying. I'll rouse the Dukes right away — they may have insight into this 'Illasera'. Let's discuss the matter in the Ducal palace before we make our move.~
@1052 = ~He won't stick his neck out for anyone, not even his own daughter — I'm sure of it.~ [LCA00011]
@1053 = ~I'll not abandon you in your hour of need, my friend. We'll rescue Rohma, together. Let's go and convene the meeting with the Dukes.~
@1054 = ~We're in this together, love. Let's go and convene the meeting with the Dukes.~ 
@1055 = ~What did the healers say? Is my father going to be alright?~ [LCCORJ36]
@1066 = ~That went well, don't you think?~ [LCCORJ27]
@1067 = ~Me too. You did a great job recounting the events.~
@1068 = ~I don't know... they seemed fearful of 'The Slayer'.~
@1069 = ~You can control that power now, and that's what matters. What happened in Spellhold, when you lost control... it can never happen again.~
@1070 = ~And it won't. I promise you.~
@1071 = ~You're right. If it did, not even your pleading on my behalf would save me. Not like last time.~
@1072 = ~That's for damn sure.~ [LCCORJ38]
@1073 = ~Good. I wonder what they're talking about...~
@1074 = ~Although... I noticed you did leave *some* things out.~
@1075 = ~Our many, ah, adventures in the bedroom.~
@1076 = ~Thanks. I keep a journal whenever I'm deployed. It helps a lot when I need to deliver reports to my superiors.~
@1077 = ~Makes sense.~
@1078 = ~I recall you smacking some sense into Nalia's aunt.~
@1079 = ~Like what?~ [LCCORJ41]
@1080 = ~Hahah... no, love, those precious memories are for *our* enjoyment only.~  
@1081 = ~Besides the mention of my transformation, yes, I thought it went well. You did a great job recounting the events.~ 
@1082 = ~Our, ah, adventures in the bedroom. Especially that one time we kept the entire inn from getting any sleep.~
@1083 = ~You competed in the Trademeet Archery Competition, and you won! You were amazing, Schael.~
@1084 = ~Oh, right. 'Lady' Delcia, the pretentious bi—~
@1085 = ~(She catches herself.)~
@1086 = ~Nevermind. I won't use that kind of language within earshot of the city officials.~ [LCCORJ35]
@1087 = ~(She looks at you with a quizzical expression.)~
@1088 = ~(She smiles.)~
@1089 = ~I appreciate that. It just wasn't pertinent to the discussion.~ [LCCORJ39]
@1090 = ~And... I look forward to making more of those kinds of memories with you, my dear.~
@1091 = ~I thought you'd tell them about the time you were nearly transformed into a vampire, by Bodhi.~
@1092 = ~Yes, well... honestly...~
@1093 = ~If I'd told them, it'd only be a matter of time before my father, and Rohma, would hear about it. I'd rather not trouble them with the knowledge of how close I was to turning into a monster.~ [LCCORJ40]
@1094 = ~But... I haven't forgotten how you saved me, <CHARNAME>. And I never will.~
@1095 = ~And I'll never forget what you did for me, Schael. My corpse would still be hanging from the Entar's gallows were it not for you.~
@1096 = ~(You share a warm embrace.)~ 
@1097 = ~There was one other thing...~ 
@1098 = ~Hm. I wonder what they're discussing...~
@1099 = ~It might be a while. As you've learned by now, the Dukes are, ehh, well-known for their long deliberations.~ 
@1100 = ~Let's take a seat on the couch over here. Hopefully it's as comfortable as it looks.~
@1101 = ~(You and Captain Corwin take a seat, and pass the time with idle chit-chat. Minutes slowly turn to hours...)~
@1102 = ~Actually, it's nothing... I wonder what they're discussing...~
@1103 = ~Thank you, Skie! <CHARNAME>, you must be thrilled!~
@1104 = ~I'm still at a loss for words.~
@1105 = ~This turned out far better than I could've dreamed...~
@1106 = ~I can hardly believe it myself. You're going to do great in your new role...~
@1107 = ~Come on love! Let's go and celebrate!~
@1108 = ~(You kiss and embrace.)~
@1109 = ~Drinks are on me, Capt - I mean, Major!~
@1110 = ~Defender of Baldur's Gate. Well done, my friend.~
@1111 = ~Defender of Baldur's Gate. Well done, my love.~
@1112 = ~Come on! Let's go get Aerie and celebrate!~
@1113 = ~Come on! Let's go get Jaheira and celebrate!~
@1114 = ~Come on! Let's go get Neera and celebrate!~
@1115 = ~Come on! Let's go get Valygar and celebrate!~
@1116 = ~Come on! Let's go get Anomen and celebrate!~
@1117 = ~Come on! Let's go and celebrate!~
@1118 = ~The Undercity... They must be nearby.~
@1119 = ~Look at this ... I count at least five distinct sets of tracks. They lead toward the temple.~
@1120 = ~Let's go.~
@1121 = ~We should scout around first. Stay alert.~
@1122 = ~Right.~
@1123 = ~Rohma!~
@1124 = ~What've you done to my daughter!?~
@1125 = ~Beno, how could you! I'm going to —~
@1126 = ~Still, there may be a way we can help. Melkor, explain.~
@1127 = ~We've crafted a special ring. It's similar to those issued to the Dukes. When worn, it will teleport the wearer to safety.~
@1128 = ~If you place this ring on your daughter's finger she will be teleported here, to safety.~
@1129 = ~Good. Give it to me.~
@1130 = ~That won't be necessary. We only need the one.~
@1131 = ~Schael is right. Once Rohma is safe, we'll put an end to Illasera, Beno, and anyone else that had a part in the kidnapping.~
@1132 = ~The man with the scar on his neck is Beno.~
@1133 = ~Skie, do you think you can sneak Rohma out of there?~
@1134 = ~How'd you get in there without them detecting you?~
@1135 = ~One of the city wizards gave us this ring. If you slip it on to Rohma's finger, she'll be teleported to safety.~
@1136 = ~(Skie takes the ring from Schael.)~
@1137 = ~Skie, whatever you do, don't put it on. You'll be teleported. You MUST place it on Rohma's finger.~
@1138 = ~We won't tell. Just be careful.~
@1139 = ~Skie, do you think you can get to Rohma without being seen?~
@1140 = ~~
@1141 = ~You wouldn't need to move her... One of the city wizards gave us this ring. If you slip it on to Rohma's finger, she'll be teleported to safety.~
@1142 = ~That's the last of them...~ [LCCORJ49]
@1143 = ~Rohma... thank Tymora that Skie got her out in time.~
@1144 = ~~
@1145 = ~Looks like Beno's still alive.~
@1146 = ~Not for long.~ [LCCORJ50]
@1147 = ~What is killing him again going to solve?~
@1148 = ~Wait!~
@1149 = ~Do your worst.~
@1150 = ~What is it?~
@1151 = ~Nevermind — do your worst.~

@1154 = ~I have the Soultaker dagger. I'll do the deed. It's the only way you'll be free of him for good.~
@1155 = ~You want to me to show him mercy? He nearly got Rohma killed, and what he did to my father... no, I'm sorry love. No mercy.~
@1156 = ~You want to me to show him mercy? He nearly got Rohma killed, and what he did to my father...~
@1157 = ~Kill him, and his friends will just resurrect him. Before long, he'll do this to you again.~
@1158 = ~But, no! I can't just let him...~
@1159 = ~(She lets out a long sigh.)~
@1160 = ~You're right. I'm letting my anger cloud my judgement. I'm an officer of the law, and I need to hold myself to a higher standard.~
@1161 = ~Come on. Help me get him up. We'll take him into custody together.~
@1162 = ~Gladly.~
@1163 = ~You're right... You have the Soultaker dagger. Give it to me, I'll do the deed. It's the only way you'll be free of him for good.~
@1164 = ~The dagger...~
@1165 = ~(Her expression turns to one of concern, as she deliberates internally on what to do.)~
@1166 = ~No... this is my responsibility. I'll do it.~

@1175 = ~I appreciate that you're willing to do this for me, but it's my responsibility.~
@1176 = ~You're right... it's the only way.~
@1177 = ~(Steely-faced, she takes a deep breath and approaches her former lover.)~
@1178 = ~You're right. Do your worst.~
@1179 = ~No... You've been forced into enough killing already.~
@1180 = ~Love, you want to me to show him mercy? He nearly got Rohma killed, and what he did to my father...~
@1181 = ~No, I'm sorry. No mercy.~

@1186 = ~(She plunges the dagger into his heart. His mouth opens as if to cry in pain, but strangely, no sound is heard. A gray mist rises out of the gaping wound in his chest, and coalesces into the form of a man; it's Beno, you're sure of it.)~
@1187 = ~(For a brief moment, the spirit gazes down at its physical body, with a look of wonder and confusion. That confusion turns to terror as the spirit is slowly drawn into the blade of the dagger. The spirit turns as if to flee, but it is no use. You hear a piercing scream in your mind as the last remnants of the spirit are swallowed up by the dagger.)~   
@1188 = ~It's over... I hope we've done the right thing.~
@1189 = ~It was the only way. He'll never trouble us again. Come — I'm sure Rohma is eager to see you, my love.~
@1190 = ~It was the only way. He'll never trouble you or your family again. Come — I'm sure Rohma is eager to see you.~
@1191 = ~Right. Let's go.~
@1192 = ~(She picks up Beno's rusted scimitar, and, after a moment of hesitation, brings it down sharply upon his neck. The first blow did not fully detach the head from the body, and you hear a grotesque, gurgling sound as Beno struggles to breathe. The second blow mercifully finishes the job. Beno's head hits the ground with a satisfying thud, then rolls a couple of feet away from his body.)~
@1193 = ~(Schael walks over to the now detached head, picks it up, and places it into her pack.)~

@1199 = ~What?~
@1200 = ~For everything... not just for today, but... for everything...~
@1201 = ~(Sigh.)~
@1202 = ~No. This is wrong. Killing you, again, isn't going to solve anything. I've at least learned that much.~ [LCCORJ45]
@1203 = ~Beno, you're under arrest for the crimes of kidnapping and attempted murder.~
@1204 = ~<CHARNAME> — help me get him on his feet. We'll take him into custody together.~

Corwin has beheaded Beno. It's a fitting punishment for what he did to Rohma and Audamar. He'll never harm anyone again.~

@1281 = ~You didn't think I would?~
@1282 = ~I've learned to rely on your skill and counsel, my friend.~
@1283 = ~It was a difficult decision.~
@1284 = ~How so?~
@1285 = ~I know it's not easy for you to be away from your family.~
@1286 = ~I need you Schael, more than anything. You know that.~
@1287 = ~This is going to be dangerous. You might get hurt, or worse.~ 
@1288 = ~Really? I thought you might be upset.~
@1289 = ~It does, but... you heard Nederlok, and the Dukes. The success of this mission is essential to the safety of this city. And that includes Rohma, and my father.~
@1290 = ~It is, but... it's worth the risk.~ 
@1291 = ~You heard Nederlok, and the Dukes. The success of this mission is essential to the safety of this city. And that includes Rohma, and my father.~
@1292 = ~And I need you. I'd drive myself crazy if I had to stay here while the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I love was out risking <PRO_HISHER> life in some faraway land.~
@1293 = ~And all of us here rely on you. I'd drive myself crazy if I had to stay here while the hero of Baldur's Gate was in some faraway land, risking <PRO_HIMHER>self to protect us.~  
@1294 = ~And for that thing that ah.. we won't talk about.~
@1295 = ~Better do what she says, lady.~    
@1296 = ~Forgive me, Nalia.~
@1297 = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@1298 = ~We could use their help.~
@1299 = ~Thank you for the offer, Drizzt, but we aren't in need of any assistance.~
@1300 = ~Of course. It was at the Ducal palace... we were under attack from Caelar's forces.~
@1301 = ~Even amidst all that chaos, I remember being capitvated by your beauty. I still am.~
@1302 = ~We defeated the assassins and left for Dragonspear shortly thereafter.~
@1303 = ~A Gift for Rohma

It's been a while since you've seen Schael's family. It may be worthwhile stopping at one of the General Stores and getting a gift for her daughter.~
@1304 = ~Meeting Schael's Family

You're eager to finally meet Schael's family, and you'd like to make a good impression. It may be worthwhile stopping at one of the General Stores in the city to see if you can find a gift for her daughter.~
@1305 = ~Slaver Conspiracy

The harbor master provided you with the shipping manifests for a new company called Winston Ventures. Unfortunately, the manifests are encrypted. You'll have to find some way to decode them.~
@1306 = ~Are you alright?~ [LCA00001]
@1307 = ~You look like you've seen a ghost.~
@1308 = ~Yes. Yes love, I'm fine. Alatos, you were saying?~
@1309 = ~I... I'm fine... ~
@1310 = ~Honey, what's wrong? You can tell me.~
@1311 = ~Alatos ... when he brought up the tunnels beneath the city ... it all came flooding back, Schael.~
@1312 = ~I understand... it was a traumatic experience, for all of us.~ [LCA00002]
@1313 = ~It's nothing... come on, let's go.~
@1314 = ~I think about it, still. Not as much as I used to, but... it's scary to think how close you were to... how close we were to —~
@1316 = ~I know, love. Come here.~ 
@1317 = ~(You share a long and tender embrace.)~
@1318 = ~Thank you, Schael... For believing in me, and for believing in us.~ 
@1319 = ~We have each other... and we have Rohma. The new memories we make together will drown out those dark echoes. You'll see.~
@1320 = ~Dark Circumstances
You and Schael shared a tender moment; it seems that the two of you are still dealing with the trauma of your escape from the city. Together, with Rohma, you and Schael hope to make new memories to silence the dark echoes of your past.~ 
@1321 = ~I look forward to it.~
@1322 = ~Really, it's nothing. Let's get moving.~
@1323 = ~It's as much yours, Schael, as it is mine. You could've killed me during my escape. Instead, you showed mercy.~
@1333 = ~We could use that to our advantage.~
@1334 = ~I see...~
@1335 = ~(She leans in.)~
@1336 = ~... of our intimacy.~
@1337 = ~Her name sounds familiar... oh, right — the earrings for Voghiln!~
@1338 = ~Hah, I'm surprised you remember.~
@1339 = ~As if I didn't hang on your every word, love.~
@1340 = ~Beautiful earrings for an even more beautiful woman. I remember.~
@1341 = ~She was a little upset when I told her I gave them away, but when I explained why, she understood.~
@1342 = ~Well... as long as your flings with her are a thing of the past...~
@1343 = ~They are. Come here.~
@1344 = ~(You kiss and embrace).~
@1345 = ~Right. Thank you, Schael.~
@1346 = ~Let's not let any past relationships jeopardize our love for one another.~
@1347 = ~(She smiles)~
@1348 = ~Sweet of you to say.~
@1349 =  ~Hey — you alright?~
@1340 = ~Seeing my cell again... it all came flooding back, Schael.~ 
@1341 = ~I think about it, still. Not just my exile, but how close I was to being —~ 
@1342 = ~Dark Circumstances
You and Schael shared a tender moment; it seems that the two of you are still dealing with the trauma of your imprisonment and exile from the city. Together, with Rohma, you and Schael hope to make new memories to silence the dark echoes of your past.~
@1343 = ~What's wrong, dear?~
@1344 = ~I think of the kindness that you showed Rohma, and how good you've been with me... ~
@1345 = ~And then I think of Beno, and how stupid I was to be with scum like that... you must think I'm a fool.~
@1346 = ~Schael, stop it. You're more than any <PRO_MANWOMAN> can hope for in this life, and you've been a great mother to Rohma.~
@1347 = ~Schael, I've never met anyone like you. I hope you understand how special you are. I do, and I know Rohma does.~
@1348 = ~Nonsense. Let go of the past, love. Focus on our future together — you, me, and Rohma.~ 
@1349 = ~The care and interest you've shown for her is more than Beno ever did.~
@1350 = ~A little humility from time to time wouldn't hurt, you know. But yes, you did leave quite the impression on her.~
@1351 = ~<CHARNAME>, yes. Sorry - I was thinking about home.~
@1352 = ~Yes, sorry. I was thinking about home. I just miss them, that's all.~
@1353 = ~Right.~
@1354 = ~Capt — Schael, wait. There's something I need to tell you.~
@1355 = ~Ah... nevermind. Let's go.~
@1356 = ~Hm?~ [BD68262]
@1357 = ~(A look of disappointment flashes across her face.)~
@1358 = ~Fine. Let's go.~
@1359 = ~I want you to know that I greatly appreciate your friendship. And I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that. But...~ 
@1360 = ~Schael... I... I didn't realize how much I needed you near me, until you were gone. Your being here, now, fills a void in my heart that I didn't know was there. I'd like for us to move past friendship, into a more serious relationship. I... I'm in love with you, Schael.~
@1361 = ~What is it? You can tell me.~
@1362 = ~The kindness that you showed her is more than her father ever did... thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1363 = ~Hall of Wonders
Captain Corwin shared the story of how she was arrested in the Hall of Wonders. The arrest changed the course of her life for the better, and helped to forge her into the woman she is today.~
@1364 = ~Curator Magda! It's good to see you, too.~
@1365 = ~How is Rohma? And your father?~
@1366 = ~They are well ma'am, thank you.~
@1367 = ~We're going to see them shortly.~
@1368 = ~Ah, good. And who're you? I don't believe we've met.~
@1369 = ~Curator Magda, allow me to introduce you to <CHARNAME>, the hero of Baldur's Gate.~
@1370 = ~We're not paying for stolen merchandise, gnome. Hand it over, or I'll have you arrested.~
@1371 = ~Not so fast. You're under arrest, for grand larceny.~
@1372 = ~If you arrest him, you'll have to arrest me too, love. Let him go.~
@1373 = ~For many years... enough time to watch the Captain here grow from a rapscallious child into the fine young woman she is today.~
@1374 = ~(She blushes.)~
@1375 = ~Oh! <CHARNAME>, Captain — a number of troubled youths from the orphanage are visiting the High Hall of Wonders, as we speak. It would mean the world to them if you can take some time out of your day to give them some words of encouragement.~
@1376 = ~Lead the way, Curator Magda.~
@1377 = ~Excuse us, ma'am.~
@1378 = ~(She pulls you aside.)~
@1379 = ~What's the problem? They're orphans — they have nothing. A few words from you could at least give them some inspiration.~
@1380 = ~Public speaking isn't my forte... but I'll do it for you, dear.~
@1381 = ~If it's just a few words, then fine.~
@1382 = ~That's better. Lead the way, Curator Magda.~
@1383 = ~... ... so you see, even the smallest act of kindness can have a profound impact.~
@1384 = ~You're not <CHARNAME>!~
@1385 = ~I assure you, I am.~
@1386 = ~What do you mean, I'm not <CHARNAME>?~
@1387 = ~<CHARNAME> has horns, you dummy.~
@1388 = ~Yeah! And a tail!~
@1389 = ~With spikes!~
@1390 = ~And when <PRO_HESHE> breathes, smoke comes out of <PRO_HISHER> nose!~
@1391 = ~That's enough, all of you. Whatever rumors you've heard are untrue. This ...~
@1392 = ~(She gestures to you.)~
@1393 = ~... is *definitely* <CHARNAME>. Show a little respect!~
@1394 = ~Prove it!~
@1395 = ~Yeah prove it, liar!~  
@1396 = ~And <PRO_HESHE>'s so ugly, that if <PRO_HESHE> looks at you, you turn to stone!~
@1397 = ~You're going to have to take my word for it. Curator Magda — we really must get going.~
@1398 = ~I could prove it... but I don't think you'd like to see that.~
@1399 = ~If you're thinking what I'm thinking... it would be a *bad* idea.~
@1400 = ~(Transform into the Slayer.)~
@1401 = ~You're right. Curator Magda — we really must get going.~
@1402 = ~<CHARNAME>, Captain, I'm so sorry about thi—~
@1403 = ~AAH!~
@1404 = ~Wow! It really is <CHARNAME>!~
@1405 = ~<CHARNAME>! You've had your fun, now that's enough!~
@1406 = ~That was wonderful, Captain. Thank you for sharing your experience with us today.~
@1407 = ~Children? Do you have any questions for Captain Corwin?~
@1408 = ~Who's the guy standing next to you?~
@1409 = ~This is <CHARNAME>, hero of Baldur's Gate and the Sword Coast!~
@1410 = ~Ah, yes Hans, go ahead.~
@1411 = ~He's gracefully agreed to share with you some words of encouragement.~
@1412 = ~She's gracefully agreed to share with you some words of encouragement.~
@1413 = ~Who's the lady standing next to you?~
@1414 = ~Curator Magda — we really must get going.~
@1415 = ~(She looks at you with a knowing smile.)~
@1416 = ~Normally I'd be against it, but it might be good to scare some sense into these kids.~
@1417 = ~Listen to me! You better be on your best behavior from now on, or <CHARNAME> will come and eat you! Do I make myself clear?~
@1418 = ~Y-yes Captain.~
@1419 = ~Right. (Transform into the Slayer).~
@1420 = ~On second thought, no. Curator Magda — we really must get going.~
@1421 = ~Are we — are we still trapped? ~
@1422 = ~I think so. Look — it seems to be a recreation of the siege. Stay alert.~
@1423 = ~This all seems so real... it's just how I remember it...~
