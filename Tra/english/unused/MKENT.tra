@0 = ~Captain? I remember these people with you from when they worked for Scar and Eltan. Well, since you've been gone, things have gone downhill. Eltan's taken ill, and he's resting in the room beside us. His healer, Rashad, keeps on saying that there's nothing he can do, but I know better. He's no healer from what I've seen. Anyhow, it don't matter; I've decided to desert the Flaming Fist before things get too hairy. I don't want to lose my life over whatever power struggle is going on in the city.~ 
@1 = ~Aye, Captain. Thank you, ma'am, I just didn't know that all you good people are still around. I know where to find Axhand.~
@2 = ~I fear no, Captain. When they brought him to headquarters, that scoundrel Dosan claimed there was evidence that shadow thieves did it - but nobody saw it but him. His men took the body away in haste, Leira may know to where.~
